the Mandarin was the biggest dissapointment for me. Marvel WTF have you done :'(;negative;-1;;
Terrible film.I like Downey but this movie is terrible.As a comic book fan my favorite is Iron Man and I am 60.I don't believe the movies did justice to Tony Stark.;negative;-1;;
This trailer still gives me chills;positive;1;;
This one of my favorite movies of the year, I don't care what other people say. This movie was a huge improvement over Iron Man 2. ;positive;1;;
Iron man 3 was TOTALLY AWESOME!!!;positive;1;;
How was this the best movie you have seen in a while? The story line made no sense whatsoever. One of the biggest letdowns of the year.;negative;-1;;
At 1:43 is the the Hulk grabing on to IRonman's legs? There is a HulkBuster suit in the movie so I guess it could be. If you enlarge the trailer to full screen size you can tell what ever it is at 1:43 of this trailer it is BIG and green.;neutral;0;;
It has already been named through various merchandise as the Iron Patriot. The war machine is a recolour of Iron Patriot's design but I don't think it'll be featured in the film;neutral;0;;
holy shit....I tought the film will be an disaster, drama...But the ending make me watch the film. Goodjob;positive;1;;
What an ending, What a movie. It was just fantastic ;positive;1;;
It's unfair for people to judge the movie due to the Mandarin. As a reader of the comic, though the movie does not follow the comic, the movie's plot and storyline is still really awesome and unexpected. It is a movie worth watching whether you read the comic or not.;positive;1;;
Its kind of a mix. Iron Patriot is normally an antagonist because Norman Osbourne is in the Iron Patriot suit. Rhodes is war machine but because Osbourne is Sony's property were left with a huge character change so he is like Iron war patriot machine. :P;neutral;0;;
Not exactly everyone will love this movie.But yes it seeriously sucks.No offense;negative;-1;;IronMan3
1:50 The musical transition here is just so perfect. It went from despair to hope, using the last note of a dark tone and bringing in the first note of the avengers theme. I get goosebumps watching this back because when you saw that avengers logo and hear the theme ring in, you just feel everything that had built up to this point in the MCU.;positive;1;;
One of the cleanest trailers ever. They foreshadowed so much without us knowing he made a conversation that really never happened and just the blending of the music sound effects everything. Just an amazing trailer;positive;1;;
1 year has passed since this trailer came out. Still gives goosebumps;positive;1;;
I feel like this movie is gonna break some records;positive;1;;
I could watch this trailer everyday for the rest of my life and still get chill bumps every time;positive;1;;
I got goosebumps all over my body till the trailer ended!;positive;1;;
This film is going to gross all the money. As in literally everything. Everything in your bank account, everything in the parking meters, those coins stuck between your couch. Everything. All the money ever in the existence of everything.;positive;1;;
Do you guys remember the time when Soul stone was the biggest mystery? and Some people made theories that Soul stone was in Wakanda.;neutral;0;;
Still the best movie and trailer to this day. Barely knew the frachise at that point. Got me so hyped back then.;;;;
"i just wanna see robert say ""no shit sherlock"" to benedict and they get very confused";neutral;0;;
Tony's gonna be salty because Peter's gonna start obsessing over the other Peter (Star-Lord);neutral;0;;
"The trauma and powerlessness I had after watching this movie will never be topped 🥺🥺
What a villain";positive;1;;
Oh wow, I can't wait to see this movie!! It's going to be completely awesome!!;positive;1;;
Its amazing how this trailer created a conversation between tony and gamora that never happened;positive;1;;
"Tony: tell me his name again
Gamora: Thanos
Subtitle: Santos";neutral;0;;
It's 2023. Sometimes I still come back and re-watch these trailers, to remind myself of how unbelievably exciting this time in the MCU was. I hope I get to feel this again in my lifetime.;positive;1;;
THIS was the MCU at its peak. The theories, the first time cross overs, thinking Cap was gonna die, seeing the GOTG mix with the Avengers and the pure might of Thanos. Nothing will top it. Star Wars of this generation.;positive;1;;
"Thanos: When I m done half of humanity will still exist
Coronavirus: My turn";neutral;0;;
This was the peak of the mcu, my god I still get pumped from watching this.;positive;1;;
I honestly don’t believe any media will ever achieve the level of worldwide hype and anticipation that Infinity War and brought. Even as the MCU expands into phase 4 and beyond, this was truly a once in a lifetime experience;positive;1;;
"Take my money, Marvel.

DO IT!!!!!!!!";positive;1;;
No body....No body in their right mind has ANY idea.....how ready my body is for this movie…;positive;1;;Inifinity War
The fight sequences in this movie are going to be insane;positive;1;;
As someone who was getting bored of the MCU, I was very surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. IMO the best MCU film in years.;positive;1;;
As someone who grew up with Asian parents, when Tony Leung said “be careful how you speak to me, boy”. I felt that…;neutral;0;;
"Shang-Chi trailer: "" My son, you can't run from your past""
Black Widow trailer: ""I'm done running from my past""";neutral;0;;
I love that this trailer has soo many good moments and yet they somehow were able to hide all the crazy fights!!!!;positive;1;;
Abomination, Dragon, Wong and the warrior dog. This movie is gonna be special. Fight sequences are looking great from now onwards.;positive;1;;
"Asian kid tryin to disobey his strict father...

Asian kids in real life: Yeah, you definitely need super powers to do that.";neutral;0;;
As a long time MCU fan, this movie added a whole new level, the same way doctor strange did. It might just be my favorite installment to date. The trailers don't do it justice!! The callbacks and cameos, the original cast, the story and the way it's all weaved together so intricately and naturally. 10/10 recommend and I can't wait to see what the future holds in store for Shang-Chi!;positive;1;;
For everyone that doesn’t know the dragon is not Fin Fang Foom. This dragon is called The Great Protector. They chose not to have Fin Fang Foom in the film from due to racism and China. It still might be a version of him but very different.;neutral;0;;
I cannot wait for the fight scenes in this. They have such a good stunt group involved. It's going to be amazing!;positive;1;;
At this point I just want to consume anything MCU related.;positive;1;;
Fun fact, the last time we saw Abomination was over 13 years ag;neutral;0;;
After seeing this movie, I feel like EVERY scene had a purpose. There were no 'filler' scenes, every moment contributed to its own part of the film. Even if you don't know everything about the mcu I highly recommend you watch it!;positive;1;;
Without a doubt one of the best and most underrated MCU movies ever created.;positive;1;;
He is the most brave child. Fighting and yelling on his Asian father.;neutral;0;;Shang Chi
When I first saw the trailer ,  seeing Jane got me worried,  I thought her arc will ruin the movie yet I stayed hopeful that it maybe as good as thor:ragnarok or even more , I thought thor will try to truly find himself , I thought  thor will travel the world with guardians and then gorr would be shown and Christian bale would be given justice , he played so nicely  and jane would just have a small cameo  where she got the hammer or would be like valkyrie in ragnarok and thor realizes that he doesn't need the hammer to control his power  , but they completely ruined it 🤦 the potential this movie had was destroyed;negative;-1;;
the worst film of the MCU. an absolute waste of time, energy and money. if the director doesn't care, why should we;negative;-1;;
It’s such a shame MCU completely screw up this epic storyline so badly.  Also, MCU continues to treat Asgardians like they are just weak and normal people like human when although they are far less powerful than Thor and Odin, they still are much much stronger and much more durable than most species in the universe because of their much denser physiology.  Even a regular Asgardian can lift tons and endure powerful energy blasts.  They also heal faster .  They should not be just a village of helpless folks as depicted in the movie..;negative;-1;;
Too bad this movie sucked.;negative;-1;;
no this movie has no right to live in this universe;negative;-1;;
