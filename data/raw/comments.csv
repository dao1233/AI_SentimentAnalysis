When I first saw the trailer ,  seeing Jane got me worried,  I thought her arc will ruin the movie yet I stayed hopeful that it maybe as good as thor:ragnarok or even more , I thought thor will try to truly find himself , I thought  thor will travel the world with guardians and then gorr would be shown and Christian bale would be given justice , he played so nicely  and jane would just have a small cameo  where she got the hammer or would be like valkyrie in ragnarok and thor realizes that he doesn't need the hammer to control his power  , but they completely ruined it 🤦 the potential this movie had was destroyed;negative;-1;;
the worst film of the MCU. an absolute waste of time, energy and money. if the director doesn't care, why should we;negative;-1;;
It’s such a shame MCU completely screw up this epic storyline so badly.  Also, MCU continues to treat Asgardians like they are just weak and normal people like human when although they are far less powerful than Thor and Odin, they still are much much stronger and much more durable than most species in the universe because of their much denser physiology.  Even a regular Asgardian can lift tons and endure powerful energy blasts.  They also heal faster .  They should not be just a village of helpless folks as depicted in the movie..;negative;-1;;
Too bad this movie sucked.;negative;-1;;
no this movie has no right to live in this universe;negative;-1;;
The first trailer had me hyped. This trailer has me ULTRA HYPED.;positive;1;;
This movie had Christian Bale and Russel Crowe and ended up being trash……wow;negative;-1;;
This movie is neither good nor bad-it’s in between. It’s overly hated. People nowadays keep hating everything-either because they compare MCU with comics and get disappointed when their favourite villains get nerfed or just because the hate is “Trendy”.;neutral;0;;
Trash movie ever;negative;-1;;
This movie was terrible and ruined by the director;negative;-1;;
Chris Hemsworth, Christian Bale and Valkyrie chick were the only shining stars in the movie. By far one of the worst movies I have ever watched. Such waste of good talented actors. Did not like Jane foster turning into Thor. Terrible storyline. The acting was similar to Tv drama standard like ‘Once upon a time’. From back in 2011. 🫢;negative;-1;;
If you took out those idiotic screaming goats, this movie would become 30% more watchable.;negative;-1;;
Such a disgusting movie, shame they kill gorr;negative;-1;;
the worst film of the MCU. an absolute waste of time, energy and money. if the director doesn't care, why should we;negative;-1;;
Watching this trailer makes me remember just how excited I was for this movies to just be underwhelmed and sad about what they did to Thor’s character, like I get him being more “human” and funny but it went just too far. Ragnarok and infinity war was the perfect mix of funny and serious thor;negative;-1;;

"Trash movie! 
Wasted Christian Bale - Gorr cast.
Trash, Trash, Trash!";negative;-1;;
Well marvel lost its grip after Stan lee died now some idoit is in charge of the show so some day they will see that he is a mistake and will fire him;negative;-1;;
Genuinely one of the worst movies, if not, the worst in THE MCU;negative;-1;;
Why did they make Thor so stupid in this one, did i miss something?;negative;-1;;
most garbage movie ive ever watched in the mcu;negative;-1;;
the script was so bad.... they under utilized Christian Bale's acting skills.  They needed to give him more lines and cut down on the romance part cringe parts... what the movie could have been with the Necro sword and the villain Gorr.  Also, I did not like their depiction of Zeus... sheesh;negative;-1;;
Movie is totally Disappointment;negative;-1;;
Total disappointment. Thor has become a parody of himself sadly.;negative;-1;;
The worst movie I've ever seen. You made Thor 2 and The Eternals seem amazing in comparison!;negative;-1;;
Totally wasted;negative;-1;;
This movie was so bad I was cringing at times. Not once but many times. Could have been so better instead of trying to be a joke. I just watched it and had to see the trailer to try and understand how they hyped such garbage. A generous 4/10 from me.;negative;-1;;
With a legend like Christian bale the movies is just a waste. Bale tried it best but movie is failure not bale. We still love you bale.;negative;-1;;
Every marvel movie now is one giant commercial for Disney , the lame music doesn't help either ,  in the beginning when Thor was in a war they make it into a fuckin comedy , way to go, marvel movies suck thanks to Disney;negative;-1;;
I like this movie. I LOVE Marvel! I LOVE Thor! ❤️;positive;1;;
Such wasted potential.;negative;-1;;
This movie had the potential, but it turned out to be a borefest!;negative;-1;;
Disgusting this was the worst movie I ever seen!!!!!!! Shame on all involved!!!;negative;-1;;
"This was such an awful film. Its really bad. Reduce one of the most  important MCU characters, ""BRING ME THANOS"" to this. It's beyond belief, and you can understand why the MCU is struggling now.";negative;-1;;
This movie turned out to be horrible;negative;-1;;
The worse Thor ever, it's crap it destroys everything that the original and genuine Thor was. This is a cheap comical knockoff.;negative;-1;;
Pure garbage and I can't believe I broke down and watched it! Nothing but, empowered women and catering to the alphabet people🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮;negative;-1;;
by far the worst marvel movie I've seen, why would they make the goats scream like that. One major mistake among many;negative;-1;;
Worse and stupid movie ever;negative;-1;;
Looks silly;negative;-1;;
Biggest disappointment of MCU history 🤷🏾‍♂️;negative;-1;;
I hate this Thor. They really turned him into a clown.;negative;-1;;
He is too goofy in this movie. I couldn't finish the movie because of that;negative;-1;;
Ruined his character this this goofy persona. Good job Hollywood.;negative;-1;;
This movie sucked, I don't know how taika can direct a movie this bad after directing Thor Ragnarok.;negative;-1;;
Biggest trash ever.;negative;-1;;
I still enjoyed this movie, hopefully we get to see more Natalie Portman;positive;1;;
Why do they always need to add a female for every super male character?? It’s soo dam annoying, they try to make it seem like women are just as powerful but no, physically or mentally men will triumph especially in marvel movies. They need to stop with these female superhero’s, seriously.;negative;-1;;
To bad this was rubbish;negative;-1;;
we'll this movie sucked;negative;-1;;
This is so dumb.;negative;-1;;
The biggest disappointment for Marvel fans;negative;-1;;
Gorr was awesome, the rest of the movie was literally the worst movie ever.;negative;-1;;
Horrible, i couldn't even finish 30 minutes, they ruined it with the “ comedy”, i turned it off when Thor was speaking to his people after the children were abducted, i mean the da*n children were abducted and ya'll still making comedy;negative;-1;;
Waste of time;negative;-1;;
Worst Thor movie. Waste of time to see a lot of jokes and nothing more.;negative;-1;;
Such a disappointment of a movie I was really hoping to see what Thor would become after endgame but he became a non serious goofy character that no one wants;negative;-1;;
Horrible movie.;negative;-1;;
"This movie is trash ..4/10
A waste of money, resources and good actors";negative;-1;;
"I have never thought it was possible to produce such a horrible movie.  This is an insult to all Marvel fans.  The comedy in this movie is 
written by and for retards.";negative;-1;;
Shame the movie was trash, the trailer was ok but nothing amazing;negative;-1;;
This movie is going to be a blast, and Gorr looks terrifying! Can't wait for this one ⚡;positive;1;;
“YOU FLICKED TOO HARD, DAMMIT!” So excited for this movie.;positive;1;;
I love how all the environments are so, so colorful bright, and then Gorr is just the absense of all color, what a contrast;positive;1;;
This trailer shows how beautiful the movie is gonna be, all the different worlds and it's richness are something else.;positive;1;;Thor: Love and Thunder
the Mandarin was the biggest dissapointment for me. Marvel WTF have you done :'(;negative;-1;;
Terrible film.I like Downey but this movie is terrible.As a comic book fan my favorite is Iron Man and I am 60.I don't believe the movies did justice to Tony Stark.;negative;-1;;
This trailer still gives me chills;positive;1;;
This one of my favorite movies of the year, I don't care what other people say. This movie was a huge improvement over Iron Man 2. ;positive;1;;
Iron man 3 was TOTALLY AWESOME!!!;positive;1;;
How was this the best movie you have seen in a while? The story line made no sense whatsoever. One of the biggest letdowns of the year.;negative;-1;;
At 1:43 is the the Hulk grabing on to IRonman's legs? There is a HulkBuster suit in the movie so I guess it could be. If you enlarge the trailer to full screen size you can tell what ever it is at 1:43 of this trailer it is BIG and green.;neutral;0;;
It has already been named through various merchandise as the Iron Patriot. The war machine is a recolour of Iron Patriot's design but I don't think it'll be featured in the film;neutral;0;;
holy shit....I tought the film will be an disaster, drama...But the ending make me watch the film. Goodjob;positive;1;;
What an ending, What a movie. It was just fantastic ;positive;1;;
It's unfair for people to judge the movie due to the Mandarin. As a reader of the comic, though the movie does not follow the comic, the movie's plot and storyline is still really awesome and unexpected. It is a movie worth watching whether you read the comic or not.;positive;1;;
Its kind of a mix. Iron Patriot is normally an antagonist because Norman Osbourne is in the Iron Patriot suit. Rhodes is war machine but because Osbourne is Sony's property were left with a huge character change so he is like Iron war patriot machine. :P;neutral;0;;
Not exactly everyone will love this movie.But yes it seeriously sucks.No offense;negative;-1;;IronMan3
1:50 The musical transition here is just so perfect. It went from despair to hope, using the last note of a dark tone and bringing in the first note of the avengers theme. I get goosebumps watching this back because when you saw that avengers logo and hear the theme ring in, you just feel everything that had built up to this point in the MCU.;positive;1;;
One of the cleanest trailers ever. They foreshadowed so much without us knowing he made a conversation that really never happened and just the blending of the music sound effects everything. Just an amazing trailer;positive;1;;
1 year has passed since this trailer came out. Still gives goosebumps;positive;1;;
I feel like this movie is gonna break some records;positive;1;;
I could watch this trailer everyday for the rest of my life and still get chill bumps every time;positive;1;;
I got goosebumps all over my body till the trailer ended!;positive;1;;
This film is going to gross all the money. As in literally everything. Everything in your bank account, everything in the parking meters, those coins stuck between your couch. Everything. All the money ever in the existence of everything.;positive;1;;
Do you guys remember the time when Soul stone was the biggest mystery? and Some people made theories that Soul stone was in Wakanda.;neutral;0;;
Still the best movie and trailer to this day. Barely knew the frachise at that point. Got me so hyped back then.;;;;
"i just wanna see robert say ""no shit sherlock"" to benedict and they get very confused";neutral;0;;
Tony's gonna be salty because Peter's gonna start obsessing over the other Peter (Star-Lord);neutral;0;;
"The trauma and powerlessness I had after watching this movie will never be topped 🥺🥺
What a villain";positive;1;;
Oh wow, I can't wait to see this movie!! It's going to be completely awesome!!;positive;1;;
Its amazing how this trailer created a conversation between tony and gamora that never happened;positive;1;;
"Tony: tell me his name again
Gamora: Thanos
Subtitle: Santos";neutral;0;;
It's 2023. Sometimes I still come back and re-watch these trailers, to remind myself of how unbelievably exciting this time in the MCU was. I hope I get to feel this again in my lifetime.;positive;1;;
THIS was the MCU at its peak. The theories, the first time cross overs, thinking Cap was gonna die, seeing the GOTG mix with the Avengers and the pure might of Thanos. Nothing will top it. Star Wars of this generation.;positive;1;;
"Thanos: When I m done half of humanity will still exist
Coronavirus: My turn";neutral;0;;
This was the peak of the mcu, my god I still get pumped from watching this.;positive;1;;
I honestly don’t believe any media will ever achieve the level of worldwide hype and anticipation that Infinity War and brought. Even as the MCU expands into phase 4 and beyond, this was truly a once in a lifetime experience;positive;1;;
"Take my money, Marvel.

DO IT!!!!!!!!";positive;1;;
No body....No body in their right mind has ANY idea.....how ready my body is for this movie…;positive;1;;Inifinity War
The fight sequences in this movie are going to be insane;positive;1;;
As someone who was getting bored of the MCU, I was very surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. IMO the best MCU film in years.;positive;1;;
As someone who grew up with Asian parents, when Tony Leung said “be careful how you speak to me, boy”. I felt that…;neutral;0;;
"Shang-Chi trailer: "" My son, you can't run from your past""
Black Widow trailer: ""I'm done running from my past""";neutral;0;;
I love that this trailer has soo many good moments and yet they somehow were able to hide all the crazy fights!!!!;positive;1;;
Abomination, Dragon, Wong and the warrior dog. This movie is gonna be special. Fight sequences are looking great from now onwards.;positive;1;;
"Asian kid tryin to disobey his strict father...

Asian kids in real life: Yeah, you definitely need super powers to do that.";neutral;0;;
As a long time MCU fan, this movie added a whole new level, the same way doctor strange did. It might just be my favorite installment to date. The trailers don't do it justice!! The callbacks and cameos, the original cast, the story and the way it's all weaved together so intricately and naturally. 10/10 recommend and I can't wait to see what the future holds in store for Shang-Chi!;positive;1;;
For everyone that doesn’t know the dragon is not Fin Fang Foom. This dragon is called The Great Protector. They chose not to have Fin Fang Foom in the film from due to racism and China. It still might be a version of him but very different.;neutral;0;;
I cannot wait for the fight scenes in this. They have such a good stunt group involved. It's going to be amazing!;positive;1;;
At this point I just want to consume anything MCU related.;positive;1;;
Fun fact, the last time we saw Abomination was over 13 years ag;neutral;0;;
After seeing this movie, I feel like EVERY scene had a purpose. There were no 'filler' scenes, every moment contributed to its own part of the film. Even if you don't know everything about the mcu I highly recommend you watch it!;positive;1;;
Without a doubt one of the best and most underrated MCU movies ever created.;positive;1;;
He is the most brave child. Fighting and yelling on his Asian father.;neutral;0;;Shang Chi
Garbage;negative;-1;;
this movie was such a huge box office flop.;negative;-1;;
Worst performing MCU movie ever made.;negative;-1;;
Boring wahmen power movie.;negative;-1;;
Really boring movie that's why it bombed.;negative;-1;;
How did they put so much money into this movie and make it look so bad. The costumes don't fit well, the CGI looks bad, the villain looks hilariously unthreatening. Whoever decided to push it in this state was smoking crack;negative;-1;;
I loved this movie;positive;1;;
The Marvels ranks as the worst movie in the history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe;negative;-1;;
This is the only MCU movie to flop, btw. Iman did look like she was having the time of her life in this movie.;negative;-1;;
Cringe.;negative;-1;;
the movie nobody wanted;negative;-1;;
Just came to put a dislike;negative;-1;;
I can see why this did so bad...looks awful!;negative;-1;;
this movie is so bad, it's no surprise everyone hates it;negative;-1;;
Most boring Marvel movie I ever watched.;negative;-1;;
Worse movie ever . Reminded me like a cosmic wizard of oz.  Was this suppose to be a marvel movie or a sing along;negative;-1;;
What's worse than one horrible superhero movie character? Three horrible superhero movie characters crammed in the same movie.;negative;-1;;
Never disliked a movie this much;negative;-1;;
Never liked a movie this much;positive;1;;
Why are these marvel movies getting so kiddish i feel like I’m watching a disney channel show;negative;-1;;
Even the characters in the trailer are confused 😅;negative;-1;;
The greatest super power of all time. Seeing light.;positive;1;;
