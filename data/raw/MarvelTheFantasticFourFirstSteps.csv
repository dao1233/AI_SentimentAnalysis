"The saddest thing about this new movie is the fact that Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, bless their hearts, are no longer around to see one of their most important creations, after years of mistreatment, finally done justice on the big screen.",positive
Most important creations? Please stop it,negative
It was not good,negative
it was mediocre,neutral
No ones watching it after the first weekend lol. It was not good. Superman was ok...and better lol,negative
im not hating. It was ok. Decent. Too jumpy...torch and things relationship was off...Pascal was miscast and they used a one off female surfer. Could have been so much better. Galactus looked terrible also,negative
"Amen to that!!! Marvel, I love you forever 3000!!! ❤❤❤",positive
it was decent. A lot of flaws...but watchable.,neutral
Dude this trailer gives me goosebumps,positive
Horrible false statement not even an opinion,negative
Just saw this movie earlier today and omg it was so good!!!,positive
I love how it’s a running joke that Ben simply refuses to say “ITS CLOBBERIN TIME”. Can’t wait to see this in IMAX,positive
"It sucks, lol. Imagine having Pedro at is worst.",negative
but it was bad,negative
"thunderbolts was leagues ahead of marvels, an actual strong film in the series of mediocre stuff marvel has put out",negative
"If your pro left wing politics you will enjoy it. If not, it will have some good points but fails to stick the landing. Or at least that's the impression I got from the test audiences that spoke about it",neutral
guess what??? it suckss!!!,negative
It will probably suck but if your keep on hoping the whole movie will not suck,negative
It's gonna suck!,negative
"The movie does nothing about it and the way ""depression""is dealt with is not just lazy that's false. It's not enough",negative
One of the small things I love most about this movie was that Ben wasn’t ever at one point ever called the thing. It was truly about family. Dom would be proud.,positive
"It's gonna feel like ascending when Ben says ""It's Clobbering Time""",positive
I JUST SAW IT ON IMAX 🍿😎it was Fantastic,positive
Saw this last night and I have to say - I absolutely loved it! Where the new superman movie has heart - this has soul.,positive
I like the idea of Franklin Richards sneezing & basically resetting the entire MCU since he can warp & change reality.,positive
I like how in this movie the comedy comes from the interaction between characters and not random throwaway jokes,positive
A good friend of mine just took me to see this movie. It was good,positive
"Still mesmerized by this animation... I haven't seen the film yet, but this is probably why I want to see it so bad now. So beautiful...",positive
I’m so glad that they didn’t actually show what Galactus looks like fully in any of the trailers! All should know Elons Xonedium.,positive
Now that is how you do the setting for a Fantastic Four movie. This Retro-Futurism is gorgeous.,positive
"Saw this specific trailer in the theaters recently, and I swear hearing that “fantastic four” chant echoing around me in the cinema was INSANE. Literal goosebumps",positive
"'Fantastic Four' is mentioned a total of 7 times in this trailer. The choir chorus says it 6 times. And, no, I'm not complaining, for I love that theme!",neutral
I didn t expect to love this as much as I do,positive
"i saw this, actually pretty good.",positive
Movie was AMAZING! LOVED IT,positive
THIS MOVIE WAS FANTASTIC,positive
Just finished watching it and I Love It. I was skeptical with silver surfer at first but its actually good. Give it a chance. Plus Galactus in IMAX is OMG 😂,positive
Does anyone else love that little bickering at the end (2:02)? It just feels so in character — I’m honestly surprised they got it right.,positive
"""That's just in the cartoon""😆That gave me a good laugh❤",positive
"I didn't read the comics but, I have watch all the 90s n 00s movies feels outdated and the characters aren't that attractive either. They could've casted better. And ben looks weird.",negative
"Best Marvel movie since Infinity War. This movie actually had a soul. It wasn't made just for the sake of releasing a movie, or making money. The script, the casting, the art direction, the cinematography, was DRIPPING with passion and love. If you're watching the trailer trying to decide if you want to see the movie, and you see this comment... I want you to know that this isn't just a comic book movie, it's a film. It's exactly what I want out of a comic book movie. It was made with love and care, it cares about the source material, and it isn't afraid to be what it is. A Fantastic Four film. It's like you've dunked your head INTO a comic book.",positive
What I really like about this trailer is that it starts off so light and innocent..until 0:45 when the bottom falls out. And the way they change the entire tone of the trailer with that one note.👍👍👍,positive
"Thank God they didn’t mess it up like they did with Superman but that's what you expect from DC movies. The Fantastic Four finally feels like it's in the right hands. What really sets it apart is that beautiful vintage touch — it gives the film a unique identity that stands out from the typical MCU formula. It feels like a respectful nod to the classic comics while still offering something fresh. If Marvel keeps this tone consistent, this might actually be the Fantastic Four film we've been waiting for.",positive
Finally a fantastic four movie that didn't suck😂😂😂😂 I was so scared I didn't watch until now I'm so happy I did 😭🥹,positive
Wasn't interested at ALL to see this new F4 movie,negative
Eh... The pizza commercial was more memorable.,negative
It's not bad movie Pedro pascal has been underutilized,neutral
They cut too much from this movie,negative
"It did a lot of things right as a movie, but didn't deliver it in the epic way it could have been.",negative
It was ok .,neutral
I was not happy when a female was cast as the Surfer.,negative
The end was so bad I don't know how to feel. The finale should be the peak. But that's not the case in this movie. The final battle was terrible. But I won't spoil from antagonist = soloed... smh,negative
And this is why I don’t see trailers they be revealing too much,negative
"Watched it yesterday. Idk, this movie was STUPID as hell.",negative
"#1. Why during the Galactus fight no one helped them. Literally not a single rocket or bullet was fired. It felt like they all are super smart, and other people are like cavemen. #2. These 4 super heroes are everything, scientist, military experts, politicians, architects. No one else did ANYTHING else in the movie, just them 4. I won't list anything else cause, I just don't want to remember everything else.",negative
This is my first time watching the trailer. I make sure I didn't see it and I'm glad I didn't. It spoils so much of the movie to an insane amount. And even have scenes from the climax of the movie. What a shame.,negative
this is soo baaaad,negative
I’m 30 min in and already on my phone. Really boring so far,negative
Another Disney destruction of a franchise,negative
"I’m here to say that the movie was great just the actors were horrible The only good one was thing and the human torch Oh btw human torch will get recasted as Ironman you heard it here first, just like cap was the human torch This new human torch looks like iron man and can definitely act like Tony",neutral
"tbh nothing fantastic on this movie , the best i can say that ''it's not bad''",neutral
Looks terrible,negative
The WORST ever remake... please STOP!,negative
when I found out they were not bringing back Tim Heidecker for this movie that was a breaking point........not seeing it in theaters,negative
I don't like the johnny,negative
not worth the time watching,negative
Not bad,neutral
On the preview the movie sucks,negative
"Saw it tonight. It was pretty good. It's a shame it came out after the oh so many boss babe super hero slop fests of late. A little slow in the beginning but all in all I was entertained and didn't feel like I was being skull f*cked by ""the message"" during the entire movie. Sue storm was a really great character. Her and Reed Richards complemented one another very well. She was motherly, nurturing, and protective. She reaches the height of her abilities when in the act of protecting her child. It was refreshing for a movie to contain a societally helpful message for the 1st time, in such a long time.",positive
"If u want a cheap movie that will ruin the Fantastic 4 movies that u saw before this, then watch this weak rip off. Such a shame. It sucks big time. A FAIL OF AN MOVIE",negative
Actually a good movie. Not the best but solid.,neutral
This looks like everything it should have been from the beginning.,neutral
Very dissatisfaction why showing Galactus soo weak . Nobody can come near to Galactus. Only negotiate n barter working,negative
I thought it was predictable n boring. They made Galactus so weak. He wasn't a threat at all.,negative
"I just watched this movie,it sucked so bad,they finally get rid of Galactus,but there's no mention of the 3 mile wide spaceship he arrived in just floating above the city😂",negative
this looks so lame,negative
Idk if I’m vibing with the casting here,negative
"This is absolutely the worse most absolutely stupid super hero, if not MOVIE, of all time. For some reason they can’t make a good movie either time out of this. That’s to bad. So much potential. This is just lame. I’d give it a zero out of ten! From casting to story line . Especially storyline! I can’t believe I paid 6 bucks for it.",negative
I hope there is no Multiverse garbage in it,negative
A female silver surfer.. really???? incredibly disappointing,negative
Thank God you can't force us to watch trash and I'm not obligated to open up my wallet for this mess. Disappear Feige we aren't buying!,negative
Very stupid,negative
disappointed,negative
"The Silver Surfer is a dude, so no. The actors don't look well cast for this. It may be great, but I'm left unenthusiastic.",negative
"I don't like the old school look at all, and the silver surfer voice sounds funny and unserious to me.",negative
Sorry I was out after i figured out it happend in futuristuc world of the 60s didn't like that.,negative
I thought it was kind of boring. I just watched superman the prior week and what a juxtaposition.,negative
"Now we seen the movie, very irritating dialogues and conversations ",negative
I have just watched this movie in the cinema. I didn’t like it. 4/10. Don’t recommend to waste your time and money. ,negative
"It's everything Superman wished it could be! I went in expecting to be disappointed. Ohhh was I wrong. This is the BEST Fantastic 4 movie ever!! Again, Marvel Cinematic Universe snatches the 🏆win🏆 from DCU!",positive
Looks honestly kinda bad i mean visually looks good but big budget movie what you expect. But the the trailer really aint giving me any hope for its quality as a movie,negative
Disaster,negative
"Just watching this..and not impresif at all, i still love the old version..(2005)",neutral
"Love the costumes, hate the casting choices",neutral
It was ok. Only the last 1/4 of the movie was good to me.,neutral
UUGGGGHHHHHHH what a TOTALLY **AWFUL** look for The Thing. I could not stand watching that awfulness for more than a couple minutes. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?!?,negative
"What had happen to our movies???? everything sucks, superman sucks, the fantastic 4 sucks....there is no more cinematic anymore everything is so cartoonist, so fake, so CGI, is just stupid, can watch it. I understand why people still watching old movies this is not even acting anymore just CGI and CARTOONS",negative
"It sucks ! A boring crap ! Also, Pedro Pascal is a complete disaster ! He doesn't fit in this character Reed Richards. Is like fish out of the waters !",negative
this is so stupid. the original fantastic four movie was just fine. we dont need this dumbass cringy 2025 remake that doesnt even have any of the right actors.,negative
"No thanks.... not even going to watch it for free on one of those dodgy sites. The cast sucks.... and they keep insulting normal People. Actualy, i dont watch anything with Fake Pedro..... By the way.... central América and some of the south were colonized by the Spanish..... so.... Pedro.... you are a Colonizer And your family probably owned American Indian slaves and slauther them for gold",negative
Brooooo This Movie is Trash,negative
