They are ruining marvel with childishness!!!! Why every movie has to be soooo childish😢. It’s become disney universe,negative
"I couldn't make it halfway through the trailer!!
What a disgusting crap, you guys have done!

Definitely one of the worst trailers and worst movies.,negative

Dumbest movie ever,negative
Literally the worst movie I've watched in so long It's mindblowing,negative
Just such terrible story telling!,negative
"Man, these comments are so filtered. Only positive comments, how strange...",neutral
"This might be the shittiest marvel movies. Who wrote the plot must be fired. I get it you need to introduce new actors and characters, but man there  is no negative word to describe it, even the trash looks better than this.",negative
"As always, it was a very creative and beautiful trailer. We are waiting for the continuation of your Marvel movies.",positive
Is this disney movie,neutral
"Marvel needs to choose good actors....
The actings are so childish.. Felt so cringe throughout the movie.",negative
"It's one of the worst movies I have seen in the past decades, if not the worst. I hate stopping movies in the middle, but I have to stop every five minutes and walk away for days so I can forget the details and continue. It has been months since I started, but I am only halfway through the movie. The movie lacks in story, decent actions (they tried but failed miserably), humor, logic, consistency in power scale, casting, directing, etc. I had much better viewing experiences at independent movie showings by high school students, who probably had less than x1/100,000 budget. I would not even recommend the movie to my worst enemies.",negative
"The marvels movie is so bad. The characters are not like in the avengers. The movie is full of narcissist,feminist,childish and I think Stan Lee wouldn't like it if he is alive.",negative
This is absolutely the worst thing I've ever seen. This movie is a joke and the villan is terrible. Actually they all suck,negative
there is not even one single white male main character. At least there is Nick Fury but he is not white,neutral
Where is the Indian superhero marvel ??,neutral
"predictable, boring, heroes never die, heroes always win. garbage.",negative
"Terrible film,  first 10min and I stopped watching",negative
Marvel has found a winning formula.  Lots of fun cameos.,neutral
This movie is actually pretty good.,positive
"When I first saw the trailer , seeing Jane got me worried, I thought her arc will ruin the movie yet I stayed hopeful that it maybe as good as thor:ragnarok or even more , I thought thor will try to truly find himself , I thought thor will travel the world with guardians and then gorr would be shown and Christian bale would be given justice , he played so nicely and jane would just have a small cameo where she got the hammer or would be like valkyrie in ragnarok and thor realizes that he doesn't need the hammer to control his power , but they completely ruined it 🤦 the potential this movie had was destroyed",negative
"the worst film of the MCU. an absolute waste of time, energy and money. if the director doesn't care, why should we",negative
"It’s such a shame MCU completely screw up this epic storyline so badly. Also, MCU continues to treat Asgardians like they are just weak and normal people like human when although they are far less powerful than Thor and Odin, they still are much much stronger and much more durable than most species in the universe because of their much denser physiology. Even a regular Asgardian can lift tons and endure powerful energy blasts. They also heal faster . They should not be just a village of helpless folks as depicted in the movie..",negative
Too bad this movie sucked.,negative
no this movie has no right to live in this universe,negative
The first trailer had me hyped. This trailer has me ULTRA HYPED.,positive
This movie had Christian Bale and Russel Crowe and ended up being trash……wow,negative
This movie is neither good nor bad-it’s in between. It’s overly hated. People nowadays keep hating everything-either because they compare MCU with comics and get disappointed when their favourite villains get nerfed or just because the hate is “Trendy”.,neutral
Trash movie ever,negative
This movie was terrible and ruined by the director,negative
"Chris Hemsworth, Christian Bale and Valkyrie chick were the only shining stars in the movie. By far one of the worst movies I have ever watched. Such waste of good talented actors. Did not like Jane foster turning into Thor. Terrible storyline. The acting was similar to Tv drama standard like ‘Once upon a time’. From back in 2011. 🫢",negative
"If you took out those idiotic screaming goats, this movie would become 30% more watchable.",negative
"Such a disgusting movie, shame they kill gorr",negative
"the worst film of the MCU. an absolute waste of time, energy and money. if the director doesn't care, why should we",negative
"Watching this trailer makes me remember just how excited I was for this movies to just be underwhelmed and sad about what they did to Thor’s character, like I get him being more “human” and funny but it went just too far. Ragnarok and infinity war was the perfect mix of funny and serious thor",negative

Wasted Christian Bale - Gorr cast.
Trash, Trash, Trash!""",negative
Well marvel lost its grip after Stan lee died now some idoit is in charge of the show so some day they will see that he is a mistake and will fire him,negative
"Genuinely one of the worst movies, if not, the worst in THE MCU",negative
"Why did they make Thor so stupid in this one, did i miss something?",negative
most garbage movie ive ever watched in the mcu,negative
"the script was so bad.... they under utilized Christian Bale's acting skills. They needed to give him more lines and cut down on the romance part cringe parts... what the movie could have been with the Necro sword and the villain Gorr. Also, I did not like their depiction of Zeus... sheesh",negative
Movie is totally Disappointment,negative
Total disappointment. Thor has become a parody of himself sadly.,negative
The worst movie I've ever seen. You made Thor 2 and The Eternals seem amazing in comparison!,negative
Totally wasted,negative
This movie was so bad I was cringing at times. Not once but many times. Could have been so better instead of trying to be a joke. I just watched it and had to see the trailer to try and understand how they hyped such garbage. A generous 4/10 from me.,negative
With a legend like Christian bale the movies is just a waste. Bale tried it best but movie is failure not bale. We still love you bale.,negative
"Every marvel movie now is one giant commercial for Disney , the lame music doesn't help either , in the beginning when Thor was in a war they make it into a fuckin comedy , way to go, marvel movies suck thanks to Disney",negative
I like this movie. I LOVE Marvel! I LOVE Thor! ❤️,positive
Such wasted potential.,negative
"This movie had the potential, but it turned out to be a borefest!",negative
Disgusting this was the worst movie I ever seen!!!!!!! Shame on all involved!!!,negative
"This was such an awful film. Its really bad. Reduce one of the most important MCU characters, ""BRING ME THANOS"" to this. It's beyond belief, and you can understand why the MCU is struggling now.",negative
This movie turned out to be horrible,negative
"The worse Thor ever, it's crap it destroys everything that the original and genuine Thor was. This is a cheap comical knockoff.",negative
"Pure garbage and I can't believe I broke down and watched it! Nothing but, empowered women and catering to the alphabet people🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮",negative

Biggest disappointment of MCU history 🤷🏾‍♂️,negative
I hate this Thor. They really turned him into a clown.,negative
He is too goofy in this movie. I couldn't finish the movie because of that,negative
Ruined his character this this goofy persona. Good job Hollywood.,negative
"This movie sucked, I don't know how taika can direct a movie this bad after directing Thor Ragnarok.",negative
Biggest trash ever.,negative
"I still enjoyed this movie, hopefully we get to see more Natalie Portman",positive
"Why do they always need to add a female for every super male character?? It’s soo dam annoying, they try to make it seem like women are just as powerful but no, physically or mentally men will triumph especially in marvel movies. They need to stop with these female superhero’s, seriously.",negative
To bad this was rubbish,negative
we'll this movie sucked,negative
This is so dumb.,negative
The biggest disappointment for Marvel fans,negative
"Gorr was awesome, the rest of the movie was literally the worst movie ever.",negative
"Horrible, i couldn't even finish 30 minutes, they ruined it with the “ comedy”, i turned it off when Thor was speaking to his people after the children were abducted, i mean the da*n children were abducted and ya'll still making comedy",negative
Waste of time,negative
Worst Thor movie. Waste of time to see a lot of jokes and nothing more.,negative
Such a disappointment of a movie I was really hoping to see what Thor would become after endgame but he became a non serious goofy character that no one wants,negative
Horrible movie.,negative
This movie is trash ..4/10,negative
"A waste of money, resources and good actors.",negative
I have never thought it was possible to produce such a horrible movie. This is an insult to all Marvel fans. The comedy in this movie is written by and for retards.,negative
"Shame the movie was trash, the trailer was ok but nothing amazing",negative
"This movie is going to be a blast, and Gorr looks terrifying! Can't wait for this one ⚡",positive
"“YOU FLICKED TOO HARD, DAMMIT!” So excited for this movie.",positive
"I love how all the environments are so, so colorful bright, and then Gorr is just the absense of all color, what a contrast",positive
"This trailer shows how beautiful the movie is gonna be, all the different worlds and it's richness are something else.",positive
the Mandarin was the biggest dissapointment for me. Marvel WTF have you done :'(,negative
Terrible film.I like Downey but this movie is terrible.As a comic book fan my favorite is Iron Man and I am 60.I don't believe the movies did justice to Tony Stark.,negative
This movie was incredible I had chills the entire time I watched it,positive
"This one of my favorite movies of the year, I don't care what other people say. This movie was a huge improvement over Iron Man 2.",positive
Iron man 3 was TOTALLY AWESOME!!!,positive
How was this the best movie you have seen in a while? The story line made no sense whatsoever. One of the biggest letdowns of the year.,negative
At 1:43 is the the Hulk grabing on to IRonman's legs? There is a HulkBuster suit in the movie so I guess it could be. If you enlarge the trailer to full screen size you can tell what ever it is at 1:43 of this trailer it is BIG and green.,neutral
It has already been named through various merchandise as the Iron Patriot. The war machine is a recolour of Iron Patriot's design but I don't think it'll be featured in the film,neutral
"holy shit....I tought the film will be an disaster, drama...But the ending make me watch the film. Goodjob",positive
"What an ending, What a movie. It was just fantastic",positive
"It's unfair for people to judge the movie due to the Mandarin. As a reader of the comic, though the movie does not follow the comic, the movie's plot and storyline is still really awesome and unexpected. It is a movie worth watching whether you read the comic or not.",positive
Its kind of a mix. Iron Patriot is normally an antagonist because Norman Osbourne is in the Iron Patriot suit. Rhodes is war machine but because Osbourne is Sony's property were left with a huge character change so he is like Iron war patriot machine. :P,neutral
Not exactly everyone will love this movie.But yes it seeriously sucks.No offense,negative
"I don't know why people hate it because he's not wearing his suit most of the time. There would be no character development if he was just always in his suit and just owning everyone with little effort. The fact that he had to struggle builds character. That's more important to the plot than just blowing everything up. If you want that, watch a Michael Bay movie.",positive
"This one of my favorite movies of the year, I don't care what other people say. This movie was a huge improvement over Iron Man 2. ",positive
best one in the series. NO ONE can replace RDJ as Tony Stark because he IS Tony Stark,positive
And in this movie you will clearly see Tony Stark destroying 60 Iron man costumes per second .,neutral
Iron man 3 is the best movie yet;],positive
"This will be the BEST Iron Man yet, And the last two were were pretty damn good.",positive
"It's pretty cool to see how the suit and him have evolved.  He could barley control it in the first movie, now he's jumping off of bridges into them and shit.  He might rely on his gadgets but he has the balls to use them.",positive
Damn this is the best trailer I've seen to date. I'm ready to see the movie!,positive
"The ending of this trailer's the best moment in the marvel cinematic universe.
So far",positive
"It's unfair for people to judge the movie due to the Mandarin. As a reader of the comic, though the movie does not follow the comic, the movie's plot and storyline is still really awesome and unexpected. It is a movie worth watching whether you read the comic or not.",positive
when a trailer gives you goosebumps you know it's gunna be goood,positive
The humor/action everything perfect!! definite watch! :),positive
the action sequences in this movie were AMAZING! omg. ,positive
"Its a awesome trailer, but the movie sucks",negative
"I'm not dogging the movie, the approach was... admirable. Really, I feel like the trailer was misleading.... It gave a good perspective of the ""take off the suit and what are you"" question... But I think it could have been written better. The first Iron Man will always be the best.",negative
when the evil green hooded guy takes his hood off he has captain americans shield tatooed on his neck.,neutral
"In the first movie, the final battle was against another person in an iron man suit. They introduced war machine in the 2nd movie. In the 3rd movie he makes a suit for Pepper only to protect her, not shown in this trailer. The suits shown at the end are sentient suits. There is not one in the suits. That's what makes this trailer so amazing. ",positive
If anyone is pondering whether to see this or not. You should. It is a very good film filled with action and loads of character development. Which is always a good thing.,positive
"In retrospect, I can totally imagine the guys who planned how they were going to market the movie to be giggling incessantly and rubbing their hands together whenever someone watched the trailer and thought it would be the ""dark"" chapter of Tony Stark's life.",negative
you're maybe not matured enough to handle the dark knight rises movie and plot developement. get lost and play the power rangers toys dumbass,negative
And in this movie you will clearly see Tony Stark destroying 60 Iron man costumes per second .,neutral

avengers was way better and i didnt even like it.,negative
"Utterly disappointed, a great talent wasted :(",negative
"says this is the best ironman movie out of the 3 on some movie sites, its the worst by far, plus they got the mandarin all wrong, the bad was really just a bad version of the human torch, it shoulda been called tony stark not ironman cause the movie goes about an hour and a half with no ironman, yawn!",negative
I thought Ironman I was terrfic.  II?  Don't so much.  My son and I are going this weekend.  Love reading through the YT comments to know what I'm in for.,neutral
A disappointing movie.,negative
This movie sucks to be honest. Only iron man fanboys would tell you it's good,negative
Saw part3 yesterday MAJOR LETDOWN!,negative
"if you watch the thor movie trailer, you'll see that it's the same song :)",neutral
"Expecting a Villain Epic, intelligent, cruel, ruthless take Hero to despair was not the mockery. Disappointing movie, zero emotion. If this was the last, is a terrible end.",negative
credits were too long to wait. what was it?,neutral
"This movie is amazing, saw it yesterday, one of the best comic book movies ever, most amazing twist, gave life to the movie, made me cry almost, genuinely gripping and fantastic at worst. Bravo Shane Black!!",positive
"I unfortunately hate this movie. In my opinion I think the mandarin part the twist is really out of place and ruins the villain in the movie. in the beginning It felt like he was a real villain kind of like the joker in the dark knight. You get this presence of a real threat even depicted in the trailers. But when the twist came, I Lost interest in the movie entireley. It is not as good as the original.",negative
"So many flaws in the movie, it doesn't deserve the praise it gets. It was entertaining and better from the second one but nothing more than that.",negative
one word to describe this movie after I watched it.....EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
"My 5 year old, 7 year old and 8 year old have seen the other Iron Men movies...is this one okay for them too?  Or is it too dark?",neutral
Ive seen this movie and no it is not the worst. Its the best iron man to me but that could be cause of the hype of a new movie. and if your thinking that because the mandarin sounds like a lame joker watch the movie ;) theres a suprise inside.,positive
"Stop bitching about the movie. Just because a superhero movie took a different turn than the rest, doesn't mean you have to be spoonfed all your storylines. You were fooled, the reason why you didn't like it was because you weren't expecting the things that happened to actually happen. Tony Stark is a stronger character because of this movie.",positive
the Mandarin was right!!! I didn't see him coming!!!! really good movie!!!!,positive
"I didn't like it at all, most of the people i know didn't like it either. Bad movie with a lot of hype. Don't waste your money.",negative
"ohh this movie was good!...just wish the mandarin took the complete role as the true villian! the character was crazy,with the hoody Robe plus the voice nnd d way he talked,ohh i could imagine how epic he would have if they developed his character into the main villian.",positive
"For the ones who haven't seen it, the trailers are so much better than the final product. There's a twist right in the middle of the movie that makes this the worst Marvel film to date. 
It's an OK movie, maybe an OK Marvel film, but is an awful Iron Man movie.
If other movies of Marvel's Phase Two are anywhere near this, Disney can start crumbling because DC and Warner are coming strong.
PS: I'm a fan of both companies",negative
this is the uk trailer,neutral
"1:50 The musical transition here is just so perfect. It went from despair to hope, using the last note of a dark tone and bringing in the first note of the avengers theme. I get goosebumps watching this back because when you saw that avengers logo and hear the theme ring in, you just feel everything that had built up to this point in the MCU.",positive
One of the cleanest trailers ever. They foreshadowed so much without us knowing he made a conversation that really never happened and just the blending of the music sound effects everything. Just an amazing trailer,positive
1 year has passed since this trailer came out. Still gives goosebumps,positive
I feel like this movie is gonna break some records,positive

The callbacks and cameos, the original cast, the story and the way it's all weaved together so intricately and naturally. 10/10 recommend and I can't wait to see what the future holds in store for Shang-Chi!",positive
For everyone that doesn’t know the dragon is not Fin Fang Foom. This dragon is called The Great Protector. They chose not to have Fin Fang Foom in the film from due to racism and China. It still might be a version of him but very different.,neutral
I cannot wait for the fight scenes in this. They have such a good stunt group involved. It's going to be amazing!,positive
At this point I just want to consume anything MCU related.,positive
