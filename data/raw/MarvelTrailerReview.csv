A tree has more facial expression than Brie Larson.,negative
I'm excited to see more of Carol's personality in this movie. She was a blank slate for most of the first movie and we have only see bits and pieces of it in Endgame,positive
The Marvels - DISASTROUS box office,negative
Wait a minute...I can see light too! 😅,neutral

This feels much more cinematic than the first trailer. So hyped!,positive
"Either the directors and the writers are the stupidest or they think of us, the audience stupider. Watching this movie was literally torture.",negative

This is the most obviously bot filled comment section I’ve ever seen 😂,neutral

"I didn’t even know this was a movie until today, and I follow the marvel universe very closely 😭",neutral
I would love to see this movie made into a musical. You go girls. 👁️👄👁️,neutral
Some folks need a perpetual enemy so they can justify their own inadequacies to themselves. It’s kind of insane,neutral
They are trying to increase the views of the videos with money,neutral
They are ruining marvel with childishness!!!! Why every movie has to be soooo childish😢. It’s become disney universe,negative
"I couldn't make it halfway through the trailer!!
What a disgusting crap, you guys have done!
Can't believe this is the Marvel that gave us Infinity War, Endgame!",negative
Definitely one of the worst trailers and worst movies.,negative

Dumbest movie ever,negative
Literally the worst movie I've watched in so long It's mindblowing,negative
Just such terrible story telling!,negative
"Man, these comments are so filtered. Only positive comments, how strange...",neutral
"This might be the shittiest marvel movies. Who wrote the plot must be fired. I get it you need to introduce new actors and characters, but man there  is no negative word to describe it, even the trash looks better than this.",negative
"As always, it was a very creative and beautiful trailer. We are waiting for the continuation of your Marvel movies.",positive
Is this disney movie,neutral
"Marvel needs to choose good actors....
The actings are so childish.. Felt so cringe throughout the movie.",negative
"It's one of the worst movies I have seen in the past decades, if not the worst. I hate stopping movies in the middle, but I have to stop every five minutes and walk away for days so I can forget the details and continue. It has been months since I started, but I am only halfway through the movie. The movie lacks in story, decent actions (they tried but failed miserably), humor, logic, consistency in power scale, casting, directing, etc. I had much better viewing experiences at independent movie showings by high school students, who probably had less than x1/100,000 budget. I would not even recommend the movie to my worst enemies.",negative
"The marvels movie is so bad. The characters are not like in the avengers. The movie is full of narcissist,feminist,childish and I think Stan Lee wouldn't like it if he is alive.",negative
This is absolutely the worst thing I've ever seen. This movie is a joke and the villan is terrible. Actually they all suck,negative
there is not even one single white male main character. At least there is Nick Fury but he is not white,neutral
Where is the Indian superhero marvel ??,neutral
"predictable, boring, heroes never die, heroes always win. garbage.",negative
"Terrible film,  first 10min and I stopped watching",negative
Marvel has found a winning formula.  Lots of fun cameos.,neutral
This movie is actually pretty good.,positive
"When I first saw the trailer , seeing Jane got me worried, I thought her arc will ruin the movie yet I stayed hopeful that it maybe as good as thor:ragnarok or even more , I thought thor will try to truly find himself , I thought thor will travel the world with guardians and then gorr would be shown and Christian bale would be given justice , he played so nicely and jane would just have a small cameo where she got the hammer or would be like valkyrie in ragnarok and thor realizes that he doesn't need the hammer to control his power , but they completely ruined it 🤦 the potential this movie had was destroyed",negative
"the worst film of the MCU. an absolute waste of time, energy and money. if the director doesn't care, why should we",negative
"It’s such a shame MCU completely screw up this epic storyline so badly. Also, MCU continues to treat Asgardians like they are just weak and normal people like human when although they are far less powerful than Thor and Odin, they still are much much stronger and much more durable than most species in the universe because of their much denser physiology. Even a regular Asgardian can lift tons and endure powerful energy blasts. They also heal faster . They should not be just a village of helpless folks as depicted in the movie..",negative
Too bad this movie sucked.,negative
no this movie has no right to live in this universe,negative
The first trailer had me hyped. This trailer has me ULTRA HYPED.,positive
This movie had Christian Bale and Russel Crowe and ended up being trash……wow,negative
This movie is neither good nor bad-it’s in between. It’s overly hated. People nowadays keep hating everything-either because they compare MCU with comics and get disappointed when their favourite villains get nerfed or just because the hate is “Trendy”.,neutral
Trash movie ever,negative
This movie was terrible and ruined by the director,negative
"Chris Hemsworth, Christian Bale and Valkyrie chick were the only shining stars in the movie. By far one of the worst movies I have ever watched. Such waste of good talented actors. Did not like Jane foster turning into Thor. Terrible storyline. The acting was similar to Tv drama standard like ‘Once upon a time’. From back in 2011. 🫢",negative
"If you took out those idiotic screaming goats, this movie would become 30% more watchable.",negative
"Such a disgusting movie, shame they kill gorr",negative
"the worst film of the MCU. an absolute waste of time, energy and money. if the director doesn't care, why should we",negative
"Watching this trailer makes me remember just how excited I was for this movies to just be underwhelmed and sad about what they did to Thor’s character, like I get him being more “human” and funny but it went just too far. Ragnarok and infinity war was the perfect mix of funny and serious thor",negative
"It’s such a shame MCU completely screw up this epic storyline so badly.

"Trash movie!
Wasted Christian Bale - Gorr cast.
Trash, Trash, Trash!""",negative
Well marvel lost its grip after Stan lee died now some idoit is in charge of the show so some day they will see that he is a mistake and will fire him,negative
"Genuinely one of the worst movies, if not, the worst in THE MCU",negative
"Why did they make Thor so stupid in this one, did i miss something?",negative
most garbage movie ive ever watched in the mcu,negative
"the script was so bad.... they under utilized Christian Bale's acting skills. They needed to give him more lines and cut down on the romance part cringe parts... what the movie could have been with the Necro sword and the villain Gorr. Also, I did not like their depiction of Zeus... sheesh",negative
Movie is totally Disappointment,negative
Total disappointment. Thor has become a parody of himself sadly.,negative
The worst movie I've ever seen. You made Thor 2 and The Eternals seem amazing in comparison!,negative
Totally wasted,negative
This movie was so bad I was cringing at times. Not once but many times. Could have been so better instead of trying to be a joke. I just watched it and had to see the trailer to try and understand how they hyped such garbage. A generous 4/10 from me.,negative
With a legend like Christian bale the movies is just a waste. Bale tried it best but movie is failure not bale. We still love you bale.,negative
"Every marvel movie now is one giant commercial for Disney , the lame music doesn't help either , in the beginning when Thor was in a war they make it into a fuckin comedy , way to go, marvel movies suck thanks to Disney",negative
I like this movie. I LOVE Marvel! I LOVE Thor! ❤️,positive
Such wasted potential.,negative
"This movie had the potential, but it turned out to be a borefest!",negative
Disgusting this was the worst movie I ever seen!!!!!!! Shame on all involved!!!,negative
"This was such an awful film. Its really bad. Reduce one of the most important MCU characters, ""BRING ME THANOS"" to this. It's beyond belief, and you can understand why the MCU is struggling now.",negative
This movie turned out to be horrible,negative
"The worse Thor ever, it's crap it destroys everything that the original and genuine Thor was. This is a cheap comical knockoff.",negative
"Pure garbage and I can't believe I broke down and watched it! Nothing but, empowered women and catering to the alphabet people🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮",negative
"by far the worst marvel movie I've seen, why would they make the goats scream like that. One major mistake among many",negative
Worse and stupid movie ever,negative
Looks silly,negative
Biggest disappointment of MCU history 🤷🏾‍♂️,negative
I hate this Thor. They really turned him into a clown.,negative
He is too goofy in this movie. I couldn't finish the movie because of that,negative
Ruined his character this this goofy persona. Good job Hollywood.,negative
"This movie sucked, I don't know how taika can direct a movie this bad after directing Thor Ragnarok.",negative
Biggest trash ever.,negative
"I still enjoyed this movie, hopefully we get to see more Natalie Portman",positive
"Why do they always need to add a female for every super male character?? It’s soo dam annoying, they try to make it seem like women are just as powerful but no, physically or mentally men will triumph especially in marvel movies. They need to stop with these female superhero’s, seriously.",negative
To bad this was rubbish,negative
we'll this movie sucked,negative
This is so dumb.,negative
The biggest disappointment for Marvel fans,negative
"Gorr was awesome, the rest of the movie was literally the worst movie ever.",negative
"Horrible, i couldn't even finish 30 minutes, they ruined it with the “ comedy”, i turned it off when Thor was speaking to his people after the children were abducted, i mean the da*n children were abducted and ya'll still making comedy",negative
Waste of time,negative
Worst Thor movie. Waste of time to see a lot of jokes and nothing more.,negative
Such a disappointment of a movie I was really hoping to see what Thor would become after endgame but he became a non serious goofy character that no one wants,negative
Horrible movie.,negative
This movie is trash ..4/10,negative
"A waste of money, resources and good actors.",negative
I have never thought it was possible to produce such a horrible movie. This is an insult to all Marvel fans. The comedy in this movie is written by and for retards.,negative
"Shame the movie was trash, the trailer was ok but nothing amazing",negative
"This movie is going to be a blast, and Gorr looks terrifying! Can't wait for this one ⚡",positive
"“YOU FLICKED TOO HARD, DAMMIT!” So excited for this movie.",positive
"I love how all the environments are so, so colorful bright, and then Gorr is just the absense of all color, what a contrast",positive
"This trailer shows how beautiful the movie is gonna be, all the different worlds and it's richness are something else.",positive
the Mandarin was the biggest dissapointment for me. Marvel WTF have you done :'(,negative
Terrible film.I like Downey but this movie is terrible.As a comic book fan my favorite is Iron Man and I am 60.I don't believe the movies did justice to Tony Stark.,negative
This trailer still gives me chills,positive
"This one of my favorite movies of the year, I don't care what other people say. This movie was a huge improvement over Iron Man 2.",positive
Iron man 3 was TOTALLY AWESOME!!!,positive
How was this the best movie you have seen in a while? The story line made no sense whatsoever. One of the biggest letdowns of the year.,negative
At 1:43 is the the Hulk grabing on to IRonman's legs? There is a HulkBuster suit in the movie so I guess it could be. If you enlarge the trailer to full screen size you can tell what ever it is at 1:43 of this trailer it is BIG and green.,neutral
It has already been named through various merchandise as the Iron Patriot. The war machine is a recolour of Iron Patriot's design but I don't think it'll be featured in the film,neutral
"holy shit....I tought the film will be an disaster, drama...But the ending make me watch the film. Goodjob",positive
"What an ending, What a movie. It was just fantastic",positive
"It's unfair for people to judge the movie due to the Mandarin. As a reader of the comic, though the movie does not follow the comic, the movie's plot and storyline is still really awesome and unexpected. It is a movie worth watching whether you read the comic or not.",positive
Its kind of a mix. Iron Patriot is normally an antagonist because Norman Osbourne is in the Iron Patriot suit. Rhodes is war machine but because Osbourne is Sony's property were left with a huge character change so he is like Iron war patriot machine. :P,neutral
Not exactly everyone will love this movie.But yes it seeriously sucks.No offense,negative
"1:50 The musical transition here is just so perfect. It went from despair to hope, using the last note of a dark tone and bringing in the first note of the avengers theme. I get goosebumps watching this back because when you saw that avengers logo and hear the theme ring in, you just feel everything that had built up to this point in the MCU.",positive
One of the cleanest trailers ever. They foreshadowed so much without us knowing he made a conversation that really never happened and just the blending of the music sound effects everything. Just an amazing trailer,positive
1 year has passed since this trailer came out. Still gives goosebumps,positive
I feel like this movie is gonna break some records,positive
I could watch this trailer everyday for the rest of my life and still get chill bumps every time,positive
I got goosebumps all over my body till the trailer ended!,positive
"This film is going to gross all the money. As in literally everything. Everything in your bank account, everything in the parking meters, those coins stuck between your couch. Everything. All the money ever in the existence of everything.",positive
Do you guys remember the time when Soul stone was the biggest mystery? and Some people made theories that Soul stone was in Wakanda.,neutral
Still the best movie and trailer to this day. Barely knew the frachise at that point. Got me so hyped back then.,positive
"i just wanna see robert say ""no shit sherlock"" to benedict and they get very confused",neutral
Tony's gonna be salty because Peter's gonna start obsessing over the other Peter (Star-Lord),neutral
The trauma and powerlessness I had after watching this movie will never be topped 🥺🥺 What a villain,positive
"Oh wow, I can't wait to see this movie!! It's going to be completely awesome!!",positive
Its amazing how this trailer created a conversation between tony and gamora that never happened,positive
"Tony: tell me his name again 
Gamora: Thanos
Subtitle: Santos""",neutral
"It's 2023. Sometimes I still come back and re-watch these trailers, to remind myself of how unbelievably exciting this time in the MCU was. I hope I get to feel this again in my lifetime.",positive
"THIS was the MCU at its peak. The theories, the first time cross overs, thinking Cap was gonna die, seeing the GOTG mix with the Avengers and the pure might of Thanos. Nothing will top it. Star Wars of this generation.",positive
"Thanos: When I m done half of humanity will still exist
Coronavirus: My turn""",neutral
"This was the peak of the mcu, my god I still get pumped from watching this.",positive
"I honestly don’t believe any media will ever achieve the level of worldwide hype and anticipation that Infinity War and brought. Even as the MCU expands into phase 4 and beyond, this was truly a once in a lifetime experience",positive
"Take my money, Marvel. DO IT!!!!!!!!""",positive
No body....No body in their right mind has ANY idea.....how ready my body is for this movie…,positive
The fight sequences in this movie are going to be insane,positive
"As someone who was getting bored of the MCU, I was very surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. IMO the best MCU film in years.",positive
"As someone who grew up with Asian parents, when Tony Leung said “be careful how you speak to me, boy”. I felt that…",neutral
"Shang-Chi trailer: "" My son, you can't run from your past""
Black Widow trailer: ""I'm done running from my past""",neutral
I love that this trailer has soo many good moments and yet they somehow were able to hide all the crazy fights!!!!,positive
"Abomination, Dragon, Wong and the warrior dog. This movie is gonna be special. Fight sequences are looking great from now onwards.",positive
"Asian kid tryin to disobey his strict father… Asian kids in real life: Yeah, you definitely need super powers to do that.""",neutral
"As a long time MCU fan, this movie added a whole new level, the same way doctor strange did. It might just be my favorite installment to date. The trailers don't do it justice!! The callbacks and cameos, the original cast, the story and the way it's all weaved together so intricately and naturally. 10/10 recommend and I can't wait to see what the future holds in store for Shang-Chi!",positive
For everyone that doesn’t know the dragon is not Fin Fang Foom. This dragon is called The Great Protector. They chose not to have Fin Fang Foom in the film from due to racism and China. It still might be a version of him but very different.,neutral
I cannot wait for the fight scenes in this. They have such a good stunt group involved. It's going to be amazing!,positive
At this point I just want to consume anything MCU related.,positive
"Fun fact, the last time we saw Abomination was over 13 years ag",neutral
"After seeing this movie, I feel like EVERY scene had a purpose. There were no 'filler' scenes, every moment contributed to its own part of the film. Even if you don't know everything about the mcu I highly recommend you watch it!",positive
Without a doubt one of the best and most underrated MCU movies ever created.,positive
He is the most brave child. Fighting and yelling on his Asian father.,neutral
