review,sentiment
"My fiancé passed away March 14, 2022 in a car accident, and Guardians is one of our favorites to watch, and wanted the soundtracks to play at our wedding. Having Spacehog in this trailer made me bawl my eyes out, as it was one of our favorite songs to play while we were cooking or dancing in the living room on our days off together. I like to think it's him saying ""hey, I'm still here."" I cannot wait to see this and feel all of the emotions.",neutral
"This movie fits, and set's us up for the blade",neutral
"Even if the movie itself was far from the best Marvel movie, this was one of the best Marvel trailers imo. Even after watching the movie, I still get chills from this trailer.",neutral
Holy trailer and holy let-down of a movie,neutral
"i hope this movie won’t lose the heart that the other two had, it looks promising!",neutral
"Although it was not the best and it is not up to par with the previous ones, Quantumania was not that bad in my opinion",neutral
Not sure I really liked the film,neutral
I just watched the movie. I have never seen due to hearing it wasn’t good. Honestly it wasn’t even bad.,neutral
"a movie it was ok, justo ok in my opinion... not bad by any means.",neutral
I only came back to write that I expected better from this movie.,neutral
It wasn't that bad but it was bad compared to Guardians of the Galaxy 3. ,neutral
It is not what i was expecting. 5 of 10.,neutral
the movie was alright,neutral
Hit take but I thought this movie was fine not great but ok for what it was,neutral
I watched the movie was ok.,neutral
Im still 50/50,neutral
"It’s certainly not perfect, but to me, it’s FAR from being bad",neutral
the new phase isn't tht good enough to watch again,neutral
everything looks fine to me,neutral
The movie was mid like the movie felt more like a star wars movie than an ant man movie while it was still good i simply think this is my least favorite ant man film,neutral
"I didn't hate it and I actually found it to be quite entertaining. Unfortunately, I get the feeling that many many many others will not be capable of liking it. It was really stupid, but it was really smart. The plot was odd, but it made sense if you understand something about string theory. It was a big huge stinking pile of tons of brand new characters and brand new species and brand new ideas all shoved as tightly together as possible into one big pile of science fiction on steroids. And then, of course, the left added their propaganda to it, but that part wasn't too terrible. I would even go so far as to say that the movie is not woke in any perceptible way. Lastly, some profanity, some of which cannot be simply edited out later on because of how it often happens at key points within the storyline. As a long time comic book nerd, I'm ok with lots of sciency stuff mixed together with lots of science fictiony stuff. I'm ok with it. I think a lot of others might not be though. A lot of others might deeply hate it. It was an interesting movie...but you had to be the sort of person who can tolerate a lot. This is not the way that Marvel will regain its audience. And, because of the profanity, I have no plans to buy the BluRay or DVD when it comes out. It was as bad as a movie can be, and still be considered good by nerds like me. I'll give it 6 out of ten stars. Plan on a whole bunch of other people giving it far fewer though.",neutral
the movie was avarage and the daughter is so annoying. we need more deaths and less idiotic characters.,neutral

Typical movie disobedient child that mouth off to her dad and gets in trouble blah blah overall it was ok,neutral
At least we get a glimpse of what this movie was supposed to be.,neutral
I’m sorry but whoever made the trailer song is a genius. Combining yellow brick road by Elton John with the Loki theme was brilliant composing. Hats off to them,positive
Whoever came up with the song and the trailer deserve a big raise.,positive
This has the potential to be the best of the Ant-Man movies.,positive
"Even if the movie itself was far from the best Marvel movie, this was one of the best Marvel trailers imo. Even after watching the movie, I still get chills from this trailer.",positive
"Jonathan Majors is such a great actor, I'm so glad he's getting his role fully enveloped within the MCU.",positive
"I love how Kang sounds so calm, yet at the same time so terrifying...😮",positive
I love how Scott says that the people who adores him often calls him as Spider-Man by mistake while the “Next Big Bad” that is Kang knows that he’s the one and only Ant-Man,positive
I see this trailer almost everyday because I work at a movie theater and it never fails to amaze me,positive
Can we take a moment to appreciate the VFX artists ? The visuals are stunning !,positive
The buildup to more comic book accurate suits is phenomenal. Can't wait.,positive
I'm obsessed with Jonathan Majors as Kang. The guy is phenomenal and clearly puts everything he has into his roles. Very excited to see what he brings to the role over the next several years.,positive
I can already tell that Majors is gonna absolutely kill it as Kang. This is gonna be amazing!!!!,positive
It’s wild how even in just this short clip you can tell that this version of Kang has an entirely different aura about him than the He Who Remains version in Loki. Really looking forward to Jonathan’s performances with the character!,positive
"I love the part where Kang goes: ""It's you! Ant-man & the Wasp: Quantumania!""",positive
Kang's lines in this trailer are giving me chills Jonathan Majors is going to give one hell of a performance here. I'm so excited!,positive
The trailer and the song go together perfectly,positive
"Round of applause for the composer who blended Elton John's ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" into the ""Loki"" theme and then back out into Yellow Brick Road. Beautifully done.",positive
"I love how vastly different He Who Remains and Kang the Conqueror are. Just from their speaking tones you can tell how different they are. HWR is more joyous and playful, especially when he still held the cards. Kang is more proud in his speaking, it has a sort of power, like he knows he more powerful than whoever he talks to, and his speaking is so cold too. Jonathan Majors is an amazing actor",positive
The quantum realm looks so beautiful,positive
"This looks awesome. Everything about it seems so disconnected from everything we’ve already seen in the mcu almost like a guardians vibe, it almost feels like a standalone scifi movie.",positive
Casting Jonathan Majors as Kang was such a great idea. He's a truly talented upcoming actor. He's just got that swag someone would need to be the next Thanos level villain.,positive
"Really excited to see Jonathan Majors play Kang. He did extremely well as he who remains, and I can already tell he's gonna deliver with this one too!",positive
Love that they turned this into a family adventure.,positive
I think this movie has a bright future,positive
"I think, Antman has one of the best and most consistent story arcs in the MCU. I love it.",positive
The amount of goosebumps this gave me is surreal. Mavel's ability to make killer trails is amazing. Can't wait for this to come out!!,positive
So excited for this movie!,positive
"Love the part where Scott walks out of a broom closest and proudly announces ""pizza time"" to a receptionist.",positive
this movie has a ton of potential and this trailer looks insane im so hyped,positive
The cinematography and the visuals in this film are insane. Hats off to Marvel!,positive
"I love it when Scott says, “Cassie!” Then it rises to a soft synth of the Elton John chords. Truly good trailer. Don’t know bout the movie itself though.",positive
"Jonathan Majors is a fantastic actor. He's very talented and has incredible screen presence. There's a special aura to him every time he appears in something. He looks great as Kang The Conqueror, a villain who I've been waiting to see adapted for a long time. I'm very happy for the success he's having.",positive
"Even thought the movie was....... controversial, the trailers were phenomenal",positive
"What I love about Kang is , that he has no powers , is no strong alien or something else . He is just smart and one of the biggest threats in the Marvel Universe . I just love that",positive
"It may be just me, but I love how they were to pull it off and give Kang his iconic face even though it may be a mask he wears while traveling",positive
"Is it just me or this movie has that guardians of the galaxy feel with all of the aliens and beautiful imagery and the song just fits, i'm so excited for this movie!!",positive
"Can't wait for Spider-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania!! Looks really good! Also glad that they gave Scott Lang some role too, he's heavily underrated.",positive
"So excited to see Jonathan majors back, his portrayal of he who remains was amazing, and can’t wait to see him as Kang!",positive
the musical score of this trailer is off the charts..i love it..,positive
I've always felt like the Ant-Man movies are super underrated. I'm very excited for this next one!,positive
"Even from a few seconds in this trailer, you can see Jonathan Majors’ incredible range. His comedic demeanour in Loki is SO different to the stoic, aloof kinda vibe he’s giving off here. I’ve literally seen this man act in one episode of a show and a 2 minute trailer and I’m already blown away by him.",positive
I really enjoy the retro-futuristic instrumental in this trailer. It definitely ties back to Loki through the music,positive
"That first scene was incredibly epic! Seeing Kang gave me chills. They might be skimping on CGI on Disney+ to save money, but I'm relieved to see they aren't pulling punches with the CGI here. Looks incredible. Really looking forward to this.",positive
"I love the Spiderman franchise, so hyped for this next instalment of it!",positive
This movie looks like it'll have major effects on the MCU big picture wise. I'm so excited to see Jonathan Majors again. He's so charismatic and I love that we'll be seeing different versions of Kang,positive
"I seriously enjoy the rendition of ""Goodbye Yellow-Brick Road"" playing in this trailer.",positive
"CGI looks incredible, i think they wont mess this up as they are introducing Kang The Conqueror. Can’t wait to see it on the big screen. Congratulations to everyone who worked on this project ",positive
Love how comic accurate they made kangs suit. It works so well on the big screen. Jonathan Majors is gonna kill it!,positive
Yes! I personally love the Ant Man movies. I think they're very underappreciated. And seeing this trailer has me even more hyped for Quantamania than I already was!!!,positive
I like the idea that every time we see kang it’s a different variant. Keeps it more interesting for the audience and no doubt for Jonathan majors. Seriously I loved him as He Who Remains and to think that’s a “nice guy” version of kang.,positive
"This looks amazing. Not gonna lie, I think this could hands down be one of the best projects out of this saga. It feels so much more grand on a cinematic scale. Always been a fan of Peyton Reed’s Ant Man films and I feel like he’s gonna knock it out of the park with this one.",positive
So Sad that so many people hate this movie i Don't understand . This movie is not that bad i love the characters of kang and the story Line is good to . Im not understand What other people want it actually 🤷🏼i like this movie,positive

"Sooooo disappointed with this one. Dads little girl, the big secret grandma is holding back, even in the realm. Think this movie was rushed and it’s has a made for children vibe. I was looking forward to it but very disappointed.",negative
I couldn't endure watching this because wasn't really hooked with the story or maybe because kathryn looks a lot like Amber heard. Haha,negative
"Lol, ""quantum realm"" looks like a sea on space? What a joke. Disliked.",negative

I just didn't like Cassie and the cringe jokes I don't want that just for once some serious story and what's with Cassie being so disrespectful to her father that's so messed up I know she meant well but wasn't needed,negative
I saw the movie yesterday with my boys the movie was total trash but i knew it would be going in horrible script and a overload of CGI i gave it a two and that was pushing it.,negative
Am I the only one tired of these movies like they made 6 of these movies and like kill of someone already also the timeline don’t make sense didn’t everyone forget who he was?,negative
"This movie convinces me to not watch another mcu movies. The era of superhero movie is in danger if they kept making movie like this. Where is the magic touch of old mcu movies like iron man series, cap America series? I guess mcu just lost in their way.",negative
Trash movie,negative
This was one of the most boring movies ever. Had nothing to do with the previous one.,negative
Trash movie. Everything after Endgame is so bad now.,negative

movie was not great,negative
What I found most annoying about the movie was Cassie. She is not likable,negative
Horrible movie!,negative
This movie was such a let down,negative
Don't even get me started on this one. Just pure garbage. Marvel have gone downhill big time since Endgame. Their only major hit since was No Way Home and that was Sony.,negative
Lame movie sorry just bad acting.,negative
So I hear this was total garbage! Lol😅,negative

"Dont watch this movie guys, is one of the worst Marvel Movies",negative
Just watched it. I find this movie cheesy and the kid is annoying.,negative
"Tooooooo bad. The film was the woooorrrrrrrrrrsssssssssssssttttttttttttttttttttt ever. I mean first it was Thanos and the entire universe battle and now its multiverse. What was the need to add Kang in the MCU, and making him the next Thanos like villain. And re casting Cassie Lang was tooooooo bad, it's because the Endgame Cassie actress wasn't that popular, very annoying. It's discrimination. Darren Cross as M.O.D.O.K(I like Darren as The Yellow Jacket) is too annoying, I thought he was dead, MCU bringing the dead back to life is just as worse as Fast and Furious. Bill Murray as villain is depressing. I don't like bringing in new new unwanted characters. I thought the storyline would be some other problem, but they added Janet's past in the Quantum Realm in this film and made it the central part of the story. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻Worst film ever",negative
Rubbish Movie. Marvel just run out of ideas to write movies and stories.,negative

This movie sucked,negative
I just finished watching the movie. It was TERRIBLE. Marvel is going in the wrong direction with their movies. It was also WOKE. They were actually promoting criminal activity. It's sick.,negative
So cringe,negative
"I am 10 mins in and I am ready to shut it off. disrespectful in so many ways, parental, politically, judicial, personal. and it sounds totally stupid- my god were even ruining our super hero movies with propaganda. i hope it just moves along after this weird and unrelatable 10 mins",negative
One of Worst movie of Marvel. No doubt in upcoming sequels they introduce Darth Vader in quantam things... Dislike,negative
Movie sucks. Marvel is imploding,negative
The movie was below average,negative
