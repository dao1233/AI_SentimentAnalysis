"My fiancé passed away March 14, 2022 in a car accident, and Guardians is one of our favorites to watch, and wanted the soundtracks to play at our wedding. Having Spacehog in this trailer made me bawl my eyes out, as it was one of our favorite songs to play while we were cooking or dancing in the living room on our days off together. I like to think it's him saying ""hey, I'm still here."" I cannot wait to see this and feel all of the emotions.",neutral
"This movie fits, and set's us up for the blade",neutral
"Even if the movie itself was far from the best Marvel movie, this was one of the best Marvel trailers imo. Even after watching the movie, I still get chills from this trailer.",neutral

"I didn't hate it and I actually found it to be quite entertaining. Unfortunately, I get the feeling that many many many others will not be capable of liking it. It was really stupid, but it was really smart. The plot was odd, but it made sense if you understand something about string theory. It was a big huge stinking pile of tons of brand new characters and brand new species and brand new ideas all shoved as tightly together as possible into one big pile of science fiction on steroids. And then, of course, the left added their propaganda to it, but that part wasn't too terrible. I would even go so far as to say that the movie is not woke in any perceptible way. Lastly, some profanity, some of which cannot be simply edited out later on because of how it often happens at key points within the storyline. As a long time comic book nerd, I'm ok with lots of sciency stuff mixed together with lots of science fictiony stuff. I'm ok with it. I think a lot of others might not be though. A lot of others might deeply hate it. It was an interesting movie...but you had to be the sort of person who can tolerate a lot. This is not the way that Marvel will regain its audience. And, because of the profanity, I have no plans to buy the BluRay or DVD when it comes out. It was as bad as a movie can be, and still be considered good by nerds like me. I'll give it 6 out of ten stars. Plan on a whole bunch of other people giving it far fewer though.",neutral
