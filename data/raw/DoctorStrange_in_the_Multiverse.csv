review,sentiment
"Not that the movie was bad, it just had every opportunity to become something insane like the trailer promised us. And it just wasn't.",neutral
This movie could have been better.,neutral
"Trailer was a 5/5, Movie barely a 3.5/5",neutral
"I'm so conflicted, getting real hyped just hearing Patrick Stewart again but I really don't want mutants to just exist because Multiverse Magic. I can feel the Sam Raimi coming off in this trailer and I love it",neutral
"The movie was okay, the trailer had me fooled, the music is awesome, can't wait for the next Doctor Strange movie to come out!",neutral
Sure the movie was OKAY,neutral
Average movie,neutral
"It wasn't that bad 5,8/10 ",neutral
"5,8/10 is neither good nor bad. The movie is neither good nor bad but it's a bad score for a movie, especially this one",neutral
Movie wasnt bad either but i expected a lot ibmean a lot,neutral
Personally I thought the movie slapped. I think the biggest problem was the fans hyping it up to be some kind of ensemble of cameos and expecting to be bigger than what it was when they never really advertised it as such. I mean they were never gonna do a whole Avengers-Level Multiverse threat in this movie. Alls the film did was lay groundwork for what will become Doomsday/Secret Wars.,neutral
"According to me the movie was over hyped, it didn't deserve that title. the movie wasn't like bad",neutral
"This is a fun popcorn movie. Other than that, it is egregiously mid.",neutral
"This movie is pretty mid, but whoever cut this trailer did an exceptional job.",neutral
"After seeing the movie, it just felt weird and I expected so much better. It wasn’t bad, I midly enjoyed it but probably one of my least favorite marvel movies.",neutral
"cgi is not bad, story does not make sense, still a fun film with good actors. 6/10 not a bad film",neutral
"It wasn't a bad movie per se, but everyone thought it's a continuation of his actions from No Way Home.",neutral
Not bad....MCU are still not done yet.,neutral
mid tier movie though,neutral
Mid movie,neutral
Anything is possible at this point. Multiverse and time travel? Looking forward to what's to come!,neutral
"Whoever made the Dr Strange casting, deserves an Oscar just for that",positive
"This is probably the Marvel movie I’m most hyped for in Phase 4 and this teaser did not disappoint. Bring on Sinister Strange, villain Scarlet Witch, Shuma-Gorath/Gargantos, and *potentially* X-Men, Fantastic Four and Deadpool! Bring on the Madness! 🔥🔥",positive
Dr. Strange is the coolest Marvel hero ever. Benedict fits perfectly this smart and sensible character!,positive
"This trailer is a masterpiece, a surprise too huge and magnificent. Dr Strange has always got that captivating aura 🔥",positive
Love when writers imagination goes wild in a good fantasy way not degrading the depth of these characters.,positive
"It's crazy that after 13 years the MCU is still going as strong as ever. WandaVision broke even more barriers for them and now this might just be their best film yet because Sam Raimi is bringing his A-Game since this is his first superhero film since Spider-Man 3. Based on the talks about this movie from insiders, they say it is going to be visually exceptional and that the VFX are going to be mind blowing. Hopefully it wins the MCU their first Oscar for editing/visual effects!",positive
Doctor Strange + Sam Raimi = Possibly the most chilling marvel movie yet.,positive
"Marvel is Unstoppable at this point, They are making one masterpiece after another.. So Hyped about this one too.",positive
"Just saw this movie last night and I LOVED it, it could've been a little longer but it was really really good.",positive
"I dunno why but, when the Marvel Studios intro appeared with like a mashup of other intros, with that music, it gave me goosebumps. It's gonna be mad crazy!",positive
"I got goosebumps when the evil strange said, "" Things just got out of hands! "". Give me chills every time i see.",positive
doesn't it just feel good to be in this era We are so blessed by these movies(You know what i'm talking about sorry no spoilers) Marvel always hits the spot with their movies they know what the fans want,positive
"Wanda and strange is a perfect duo, they represent different sides of the same magical coin. Raw emotionally driven power and refined calculated spells serving an elevated purpose. Both great actors and characters and I am so excited for this movie!",positive
It's crazy since infinity war and end game we are constantly saying whatever they've released is the best or one of the best movies they've made. As a kid never thought I'd see all this and now that I do I still can't believe I am and how they keep raising the bar. I'm so excited for this movie,positive
2025 still my favorite character in Marvel,positive
"This is what we're waiting for. Marvel at its peak, and still they're building legacies ♥️ Love you guys 😍",positive
"This movie looks super interesting, the MCU(or maybe MCM since it’s a multiverse now) has really changed so much, it’s practically unrecognizable from what it used to be!",positive
I really loved Dr. Strange in What if... Can't wait to see his Evil side. It would be much more intense,positive
"I gotta say, Disney has made some terrible decisions but when it comes to Marvel with a few exceptions, they've done an amazing job on almost every MCU movie this far. Can't wait to see more",positive
2022 is gonna be a very good year for Marvel I can already tell. The visuals of this teaser already look incredible!,positive
This Film amazed me I recommend it I was Quite Surprised so since it’s out,positive
"Hyped for this! The prequel movie was really good, had lots and lots of replay value. But this movie will be even better. The multiverse has a lot of surprises waiting to be seen with our human eyes…",positive
"Doctor Strange is one of my favorite Marvel characters, and I'm obsessed with the magic side of things, and I'm glad that they are finally being represented in the MCU alot more, soooo hype for this movie!!",positive
"This movie is going to be the most cinematically bold, immersive, eye-opening, and most aesthetically gorgeous yet terrifying that Marvel Studios has ever done!!! So excited to see Wanda back and in a new outfit as the Scarlet Witch, Wong and his new Sorcerer Supreme outfit, and to see newcomer and future Young Avenger member America Chavez! I'm already looking forward to this after watching No Way Home",positive
"Really excited to see what Sam Raimi will do with this one. He is a great director and basically the man behind this superhero madness, having directed the movie that started everything, and also the first MCU movie technically",positive
Trailer 4.5/5 Movie 3/5,negative
"I am so excited for this movie! Not only to learn more about the multiverse, but also to see he Scarlet frickin' Witch in all of her glory alongside the master of the mystic arts, Dr.Strange!",positive
"This movie is so good, story is good everything is perfect. Some people just didn't like it because of their own expectations. Dude really expected tom cruise to be iron man, people also expected tobey to show up and deadpool. The movie is perfect, you just got disappointed by your own high expectations hahaha",positive
The trailer doesn’t even match what the plot of the movie really is,positive
I love evil strange!! The way he delivers that dialogue is just perfect!! 1:49 And that evil smile it's just perfect!! I love that killer smile of Benedict Cumberbatch!! He looks like a character drawn out of a comic book!!🔥🔥😍,positive
DSMOM was a disappoinment. The entire movie only focus on Wanda. MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS but only visit one universe. The trailer pranked fanbase.,negative
the movie will be legendary,positive
"The movie is not bad, but I have to say that it does not fit the multiverse concept very well. Many people had very high expectations, they said it would be a horror movie or something, everyone was surprised because Marvel was making a horror movie for the first time, then they gave up and the movie was re-shot. The movie, which was 2 hours and 30 minutes, was reduced to 1 hour and 59 minutes.",neutral
This is just me. I’m left disappointed. False advertising on Marvel’s end. What is it with Sam Raimi and campy humor?,negative
"This movie had potential, but instead it was rushed and wasted!",negative
"The writing in this film was god awful, and it is more Wandavision 2 feat. Dr Strange than Doctor Strange 2.",negative
Hmmmm first horror movie in marvel...looking forward to this,neutral
don’t know how they managed to make a doctor strange movie bad,negative
God this movie was disappointing first go around.,negative
"Rewatched it again, not so bad.",neutral
this movie had so much potential....but it sucks,negative
it makes me so sad that the movie isn't good.,negative
"too bad the actual movie sucks. Raimi did what he could with what he was given, but Waldron ruined the movie with his shitty writing. Waldron is the next Alex Kurtzman, a shitty writer that they hired to try to write and build cinematic universes only to FAIL. HORRIBLY… and Waldron and Gao RUINED the MCU….",negative
"I watched the movie, and I was disappointed. I came in extremely hyped, but the trailer was just the biggest bait ever. Honestly, I'd rather watch the movie of the trailer's implied version than the actual one that came out. Just an opinion.",negative
The movie still wasn't bad. But the expectations were not met for me :(,neutral
"The movie was a big disappointment, writer didn’t read the script of Wanda vision and the movie main focus was Wanda instead of Doctor strange . Sam raimi doesn’t care about the doctor strange character at all . The Cameos was just a money grabbing tactical option that’s it",negative
"this trailer was SOOOOO misleading, WHY IN THE HELL WOULD IT START WITH ""dont cast that spell its too dangerous"" it makes it sound like the stakes and dangers and destruction are being caused because of the spells dr Strange did in spiderman no way home, rewatching this trailer honestly makes me dislike dr Strange 2 even more",negative
I hate marvel after they add illuminati in this movie,negative
That's so lame,negative
What a disappointing movie this was,negative
"I’m sorry, but I think the multiverse is lazy story telling. It’s taking someone else’s work from a another movie and throwing it into your movie instead of taking the time to make a story for that character in your universe.",negative
It's Feel awful... when In this movie every avengers characters died easily....I mean why!,negative
BAIT AND SWITCH GARBAGE,negative
So dissapointed how marvel just wasted all potential line on this trailer by shitty storyline,negative
"Dissapointed to see that in fact not Strange was the villain here, but crybaby Wanda that lost her imaginery kids, L take",negative
This movie sucked. Iron Man 2 of Phase 4. It could have been so much better.,negative
Well they lied to us,negative
I mean im ok with watching some scary films but I don’t think my family will like this movie,neutral
the movie was a massive disappointment,negative
this movie sucked thor sucked. marvel is going downhill. maybe black panther will bomb,negative
"The worst marvel movie of all. Stupid story, comedy lame, effects okay - reminded me of Venom 2 which was also that bad following movie.. very sad",negative
One of the most disappointed marvel movie,negative
"The movie is unfortunately weak and poorly scripted. They are pushing politics into the movie as well. The characters are rushed and misplaced. The end objective is unlear, I wonder if I just watched a marvel movie or not. Except the excellent cgi, must rather say excellently weak and boring storyline. However oddly one of the best trailers that got me wanting more to see it, but disappointed now more than ever of the direction marvel is heading here on",negative
this gives me a bad feeling,negative
Do not watch this pos movie it's so woke It needs to take a nap. fortunately for me I was able to get a full refund 20 minutes into this pos. So disappointed with what Disney's done to the Marvel franchise.,negative
this film is sooooo badddddddddddd,negative
"I was really excited for this movie but was let down, not because I was expecting a cameo movie, because the trailer was nothing like the movie, I did not enjoy what they did with the villian because it just defeats the point of one of the Disney plus shows and dumb people are still defending the villian even after killing so many innocent lives. This movie did not feel like a doctor strange movie, he was literally nerfed so hard and kept getting defeated every time, HE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THIS WEAK, IF THE MAIN VILLIAN IS STRONG BECAUSE THEY WERE STRONG IN THE COMICS HE SHOULD BE STRONG AS WELL BECAUSE HE IS STRONGER IN THE COMICS. This movie gets a 3/10 for me, Sam raimi couldn't even save this movie. Idc what anyone thinks of this, it's my opinion, deal with it I'm not going to suck up to a movie that did my FAVORITE SUPER HERO DIRTY IN HIS OWN MOVIE. MCU IS DEAD.",negative
"Just watched it and amazingly despite having same artists, same production company, and technology it's sooo boring!!!",negative
