review,sentiment
8 years later and still one of MARVEL’s best teaser trailers.,positive
Crazy how the line “he is a friend from work” came from a make-a-wish kid that was visiting the set while they were shooting the movie. The kid said “you should say he is a friend from work when you see him” and boom. Its in the movie. Crazy.,positive
Whoever designed this trailer needs an Oscar or a promotion,positive
"Let’s admit, this is the best trailer out of any mcu movie",positive
The music makes this trailer like 100x more awesome,positive
Led Zeppelin makes everything better. True fact,positive
This whole marvel universe/series of movies is one of the greatest things of my generation.,positive
I installed a loop plugin for this.,positive
The real question is will the janitor be worthy enough to clean up the pieces?,neutral
"To this day the best Marvel Teaser Trailer. Sets the tone, but doesn’t give away the surprises.",positive
This cinematic universe they've created is marvelous.,positive
1000th like,positive
its GLORIOUS,positive
I'm here after thor love and thunder just to remind myself when thor was awesome...,negative
Man this still holds up even after watching the movie.,positive
"It’s well intentioned but ultimately numbing, an instance of fun overkill whose ultimate goal seems to be to put us into a special-effects coma. Not even the occasional inspired touch can save it.",negative
It certainly coordinated things well to leave impressions. The trailer takes careful pains to underline just how impossible it will be to stop Hela by normal superhero methods.,positive
"Thor throws Mjolnir and Hela just catches it headfirst. As ""The Immigrant Song""'s intro ramps up the tension, she makes a pants-wetting display of power by calmly, slowly gripping her bare fingers around the Uru relic tight enough to shatter it; her face never tenses or even changes expression from that bemused smirk. At the moment the magic contained within explodes outward, the real melody and action starts.",positive
"Honestly, the teaser was better than the trailer.",negative
yeah a lot of things in the trailer didn't actually happened in the movie.,negative
I did! I went to opening night last night and saw it! It was awesome! I was so happy to hear this song in the movie twice,positive
This trailer is some kind of brain poison. I am addicted and watching it all day.,positive
"Not saying this trailer is bad at all, but going into the theatre without knowing anything really payed off",neutral
"Jek well, it wouldn't matter cause a lot of the stuff in the trailer is either different or didn't show up at all. But yeah I think watching the movie before the trailer is more exciting but I can't ever skip a trailer by marvel.",neutral
"""YES! We know each other from work!"" This is why I've been waiting for a year for this movie....",positive
2019 and this is still one of the best teaser trailers.,positive
"""WE KNOW EACHOTHER, HE'S A FRIEND FROM WORK!"" Thor, Thor I love you.",positive
I don't remember the last time I've rewatched a single trailer this many times.,positive
Well this trailer just came out of no where,neutral
Hulk's Armor isn't needed. It's like covering a tank with cloth.,negative
Did you notice how hela break Thor's hammer in 2 different places? One place in trailer another place in movie!!!,neutral
This trailer is damn near perfect. Whoever cut this together deserves all the awesome. I haven't liked a trailer this much since Watchmen.,positive
Cate Blanchett looks like a completely different person with that makeup and hair she looks 20 years younger and its HOT! that smile while she's holding his rock hard hammer and then destroys its a HUGE turn on,positive
i legit dont understand why they cut this bit out. It would have been so cool to see that,negative
"My fiancé passed away March 14, 2022 in a car accident, and Guardians is one of our favorites to watch, and wanted the soundtracks to play at our wedding. Having Spacehog in this trailer made me bawl my eyes out, as it was one of our favorite songs to play while we were cooking or dancing in the living room on our days off together. I like to think it's him saying ""hey, I'm still here."" I cannot wait to see this and feel all of the emotions.",neutral
"This movie fits, and set's us up for the blade",neutral
"Even if the movie itself was far from the best Marvel movie, this was one of the best Marvel trailers imo. Even after watching the movie, I still get chills from this trailer.",neutral
Holy trailer and holy let-down of a movie,neutral
"i hope this movie won’t lose the heart that the other two had, it looks promising!",neutral
"Although it was not the best and it is not up to par with the previous ones, Quantumania was not that bad in my opinion",neutral
Not sure I really liked the film,neutral
I just watched the movie. I have never seen due to hearing it wasn’t good. Honestly it wasn’t even bad.,neutral
"a movie it was ok, justo ok in my opinion... not bad by any means.",neutral
I only came back to write that I expected better from this movie.,neutral
It wasn't that bad but it was bad compared to Guardians of the Galaxy 3. ,neutral
It is not what i was expecting. 5 of 10.,neutral
the movie was alright,neutral
Hit take but I thought this movie was fine not great but ok for what it was,neutral
I watched the movie was ok.,neutral
Im still 50/50,neutral
"It’s certainly not perfect, but to me, it’s FAR from being bad",neutral
the new phase isn't tht good enough to watch again,neutral
everything looks fine to me,neutral
The movie was mid like the movie felt more like a star wars movie than an ant man movie while it was still good i simply think this is my least favorite ant man film,neutral
"I didn't hate it and I actually found it to be quite entertaining. Unfortunately, I get the feeling that many many many others will not be capable of liking it. It was really stupid, but it was really smart. The plot was odd, but it made sense if you understand something about string theory. It was a big huge stinking pile of tons of brand new characters and brand new species and brand new ideas all shoved as tightly together as possible into one big pile of science fiction on steroids. And then, of course, the left added their propaganda to it, but that part wasn't too terrible. I would even go so far as to say that the movie is not woke in any perceptible way. Lastly, some profanity, some of which cannot be simply edited out later on because of how it often happens at key points within the storyline. As a long time comic book nerd, I'm ok with lots of sciency stuff mixed together with lots of science fictiony stuff. I'm ok with it. I think a lot of others might not be though. A lot of others might deeply hate it. It was an interesting movie...but you had to be the sort of person who can tolerate a lot. This is not the way that Marvel will regain its audience. And, because of the profanity, I have no plans to buy the BluRay or DVD when it comes out. It was as bad as a movie can be, and still be considered good by nerds like me. I'll give it 6 out of ten stars. Plan on a whole bunch of other people giving it far fewer though.",neutral
the movie was avarage and the daughter is so annoying. we need more deaths and less idiotic characters.,neutral
movies are not that bad …..but no excitement coz of trailer spoilers,neutral
The movie is both awesome and awful at the same time(in my opinion).,neutral

Typical movie disobedient child that mouth off to her dad and gets in trouble blah blah overall it was ok,neutral
At least we get a glimpse of what this movie was supposed to be.,neutral
I’m sorry but whoever made the trailer song is a genius. Combining yellow brick road by Elton John with the Loki theme was brilliant composing. Hats off to them,positive
Whoever came up with the song and the trailer deserve a big raise.,positive
This has the potential to be the best of the Ant-Man movies.,positive
"Even if the movie itself was far from the best Marvel movie, this was one of the best Marvel trailers imo. Even after watching the movie, I still get chills from this trailer.",positive
"Jonathan Majors is such a great actor, I'm so glad he's getting his role fully enveloped within the MCU.",positive
"I love how Kang sounds so calm, yet at the same time so terrifying...😮",positive
I love how Scott says that the people who adores him often calls him as Spider-Man by mistake while the “Next Big Bad” that is Kang knows that he’s the one and only Ant-Man,positive
I see this trailer almost everyday because I work at a movie theater and it never fails to amaze me,positive
Can we take a moment to appreciate the VFX artists ? The visuals are stunning !,positive
The buildup to more comic book accurate suits is phenomenal. Can't wait.,positive
I'm obsessed with Jonathan Majors as Kang. The guy is phenomenal and clearly puts everything he has into his roles. Very excited to see what he brings to the role over the next several years.,positive
I can already tell that Majors is gonna absolutely kill it as Kang. This is gonna be amazing!!!!,positive
It’s wild how even in just this short clip you can tell that this version of Kang has an entirely different aura about him than the He Who Remains version in Loki. Really looking forward to Jonathan’s performances with the character!,positive
"I love the part where Kang goes: ""It's you! Ant-man & the Wasp: Quantumania!""",positive
Kang's lines in this trailer are giving me chills Jonathan Majors is going to give one hell of a performance here. I'm so excited!,positive
The trailer and the song go together perfectly,positive
"Round of applause for the composer who blended Elton John's ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" into the ""Loki"" theme and then back out into Yellow Brick Road. Beautifully done.",positive
"I love how vastly different He Who Remains and Kang the Conqueror are. Just from their speaking tones you can tell how different they are. HWR is more joyous and playful, especially when he still held the cards. Kang is more proud in his speaking, it has a sort of power, like he knows he more powerful than whoever he talks to, and his speaking is so cold too. Jonathan Majors is an amazing actor",positive
The quantum realm looks so beautiful,positive
"This looks awesome. Everything about it seems so disconnected from everything we’ve already seen in the mcu almost like a guardians vibe, it almost feels like a standalone scifi movie.",positive
Casting Jonathan Majors as Kang was such a great idea. He's a truly talented upcoming actor. He's just got that swag someone would need to be the next Thanos level villain.,positive
"Really excited to see Jonathan Majors play Kang. He did extremely well as he who remains, and I can already tell he's gonna deliver with this one too!",positive
Love that they turned this into a family adventure.,positive
I think this movie has a bright future,positive
"I think, Antman has one of the best and most consistent story arcs in the MCU. I love it.",positive
The amount of goosebumps this gave me is surreal. Mavel's ability to make killer trails is amazing. Can't wait for this to come out!!,positive
So excited for this movie!,positive
"Love the part where Scott walks out of a broom closest and proudly announces ""pizza time"" to a receptionist.",positive
this movie has a ton of potential and this trailer looks insane im so hyped,positive
The cinematography and the visuals in this film are insane. Hats off to Marvel!,positive
"I love it when Scott says, “Cassie!” Then it rises to a soft synth of the Elton John chords. Truly good trailer. Don’t know bout the movie itself though.",positive
"Jonathan Majors is a fantastic actor. He's very talented and has incredible screen presence. There's a special aura to him every time he appears in something. He looks great as Kang The Conqueror, a villain who I've been waiting to see adapted for a long time. I'm very happy for the success he's having.",positive
"Even thought the movie was....... controversial, the trailers were phenomenal",positive
"What I love about Kang is , that he has no powers , is no strong alien or something else . He is just smart and one of the biggest threats in the Marvel Universe . I just love that",positive
"It may be just me, but I love how they were to pull it off and give Kang his iconic face even though it may be a mask he wears while traveling",positive
"Is it just me or this movie has that guardians of the galaxy feel with all of the aliens and beautiful imagery and the song just fits, i'm so excited for this movie!!",positive
"Can't wait for Spider-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania!! Looks really good! Also glad that they gave Scott Lang some role too, he's heavily underrated.",positive
"So excited to see Jonathan majors back, his portrayal of he who remains was amazing, and can’t wait to see him as Kang!",positive
the musical score of this trailer is off the charts..i love it..,positive
I've always felt like the Ant-Man movies are super underrated. I'm very excited for this next one!,positive
"Even from a few seconds in this trailer, you can see Jonathan Majors’ incredible range. His comedic demeanour in Loki is SO different to the stoic, aloof kinda vibe he’s giving off here. I’ve literally seen this man act in one episode of a show and a 2 minute trailer and I’m already blown away by him.",positive
I really enjoy the retro-futuristic instrumental in this trailer. It definitely ties back to Loki through the music,positive
"That first scene was incredibly epic! Seeing Kang gave me chills. They might be skimping on CGI on Disney+ to save money, but I'm relieved to see they aren't pulling punches with the CGI here. Looks incredible. Really looking forward to this.",positive
"I love the Spiderman franchise, so hyped for this next instalment of it!",positive
This movie looks like it'll have major effects on the MCU big picture wise. I'm so excited to see Jonathan Majors again. He's so charismatic and I love that we'll be seeing different versions of Kang,positive
"I seriously enjoy the rendition of ""Goodbye Yellow-Brick Road"" playing in this trailer.",positive
"CGI looks incredible, i think they wont mess this up as they are introducing Kang The Conqueror. Can’t wait to see it on the big screen. Congratulations to everyone who worked on this project ",positive
Love how comic accurate they made kangs suit. It works so well on the big screen. Jonathan Majors is gonna kill it!,positive
Yes! I personally love the Ant Man movies. I think they're very underappreciated. And seeing this trailer has me even more hyped for Quantamania than I already was!!!,positive
I like the idea that every time we see kang it’s a different variant. Keeps it more interesting for the audience and no doubt for Jonathan majors. Seriously I loved him as He Who Remains and to think that’s a “nice guy” version of kang.,positive
"This looks amazing. Not gonna lie, I think this could hands down be one of the best projects out of this saga. It feels so much more grand on a cinematic scale. Always been a fan of Peyton Reed’s Ant Man films and I feel like he’s gonna knock it out of the park with this one.",positive
So Sad that so many people hate this movie i Don't understand . This movie is not that bad i love the characters of kang and the story Line is good to . Im not understand What other people want it actually 🤷🏼i like this movie,positive
"Omg , what a waste of time , i just watched",negative
Glad I haven't paid money to watch a Marvel movie since End Game. They have gone down the toilet.,negative
Too bored,negative
The movie was meeeh... I didn't like it,negative
Watched the movie and I'm disappointed. Spider-man wasn't there,negative

Aaaaand it BOMBED. HOT GARBAGE.,negative
Man!! I can’t believe this movie turned out to be a disappointment,negative
It was boring tough...the villain didn't potray much,negative
78% It is very ugly movie :),negative
"Sooooo disappointed with this one. Dads little girl, the big secret grandma is holding back, even in the realm. Think this movie was rushed and it’s has a made for children vibe. I was looking forward to it but very disappointed.",negative
I couldn't endure watching this because wasn't really hooked with the story or maybe because kathryn looks a lot like Amber heard. Haha,negative
"Lol, ""quantum realm"" looks like a sea on space? What a joke. Disliked.",negative
What a waste of my time. These movie get worse and worse. I am glad i did not went to cinema for this...,negative
I just didn't like Cassie and the cringe jokes I don't want that just for once some serious story and what's with Cassie being so disrespectful to her father that's so messed up I know she meant well but wasn't needed,negative
I saw the movie yesterday with my boys the movie was total trash but i knew it would be going in horrible script and a overload of CGI i gave it a two and that was pushing it.,negative
Am I the only one tired of these movies like they made 6 of these movies and like kill of someone already also the timeline don’t make sense didn’t everyone forget who he was?,negative
"This movie convinces me to not watch another mcu movies. The era of superhero movie is in danger if they kept making movie like this. Where is the magic touch of old mcu movies like iron man series, cap America series? I guess mcu just lost in their way.",negative
Trash movie,negative
This was one of the most boring movies ever. Had nothing to do with the previous one.,negative
Trash movie. Everything after Endgame is so bad now.,negative
A bit boring movie for me.,negative
Loved the first 2 but how stupid that movie was.,negative
This is a disaster ..dont watch this,negative
"Just watched half of this movie and hated every minute of it, I couldn't stomach to finish it. It was unbearably clichè, cringe, poorly written and felt wholey unoriginal. Why does Disney turn everything it touches into 💩?",negative
movie was not great,negative
What I found most annoying about the movie was Cassie. She is not likable,negative
Horrible movie!,negative
This movie was such a let down,negative
Don't even get me started on this one. Just pure garbage. Marvel have gone downhill big time since Endgame. Their only major hit since was No Way Home and that was Sony.,negative
Lame movie sorry just bad acting.,negative
So I hear this was total garbage! Lol😅,negative
OMG this movie sucked why does ant mans families hate him why is Cassie so annoying didn't ant man save the entire universe like a quadrilion of live or maybe even googleilion lives!!!! Why did they do such a bad job with this movie???,negative
Worst movie I’ve ever seen,negative
"And they were putting this trash in ads, oh the irony",negative
This movie was SUCH a hot mess.,negative
Movie is crap,negative
What a disappointment. Such a lackluster movie with zero stakes. Utter bore.,negative
Why everyone in this movie acting so seriously like it’s their job. Boring,negative
"I just watched the movie and it was a 3/10 what the hell has happened to Marvel, current marvel is @ss pathetic storyline, pathetic plots, pathetic villains “Kang” the conqueror 🤡poor dialogues, annoying characters etc DC is million times better than current MCU !",negative
This look soooo boring,negative
what a dissappointment of a movie,negative
Movie is just bad. Bad story telling. Marvel is going down hill,negative

"What a disaster movie.. I lose two hours of my life, the others movies they were greatest so far.",negative
"Dont watch this movie guys, is one of the worst Marvel Movies",negative
Just watched it. I find this movie cheesy and the kid is annoying.,negative
"Tooooooo bad. The film was the woooorrrrrrrrrrsssssssssssssttttttttttttttttttttt ever. I mean first it was Thanos and the entire universe battle and now its multiverse. What was the need to add Kang in the MCU, and making him the next Thanos like villain. And re casting Cassie Lang was tooooooo bad, it's because the Endgame Cassie actress wasn't that popular, very annoying. It's discrimination. Darren Cross as M.O.D.O.K(I like Darren as The Yellow Jacket) is too annoying, I thought he was dead, MCU bringing the dead back to life is just as worse as Fast and Furious. Bill Murray as villain is depressing. I don't like bringing in new new unwanted characters. I thought the storyline would be some other problem, but they added Janet's past in the Quantum Realm in this film and made it the central part of the story. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻Worst film ever",negative
Rubbish Movie. Marvel just run out of ideas to write movies and stories.,negative
Story is so weak,negative
"Terrible movie. This is what happens when you make movies for ""modern audiences"". Garbage in, garbage out.",negative
"This movie flopped so bad, I tried to warn ya.",negative
"This movie was TERRIBLE, my least favorite MCU movie ever. I really think they should of stopped after Endgame, I don’t like the direction they are taking all these characters.",negative
The movie is boring. Marvel just use more action,negative
This movie sucked,negative
I just finished watching the movie. It was TERRIBLE. Marvel is going in the wrong direction with their movies. It was also WOKE. They were actually promoting criminal activity. It's sick.,negative
So cringe,negative
"I am 10 mins in and I am ready to shut it off. disrespectful in so many ways, parental, politically, judicial, personal. and it sounds totally stupid- my god were even ruining our super hero movies with propaganda. i hope it just moves along after this weird and unrelatable 10 mins",negative
One of Worst movie of Marvel. No doubt in upcoming sequels they introduce Darth Vader in quantam things... Dislike,negative
Movie sucks. Marvel is imploding,negative
The movie was below average,negative
The movie was below mid and just 3 out of 10,negative
"The saddest thing about this new movie is the fact that Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, bless their hearts, are no longer around to see one of their most important creations, after years of mistreatment, finally done justice on the big screen.",positive
Most important creations? Please stop it,negative
It was not good,negative
it was mediocre,neutral
No ones watching it after the first weekend lol. It was not good. Superman was ok...and better lol,negative
im not hating. It was ok. Decent. Too jumpy...torch and things relationship was off...Pascal was miscast and they used a one off female surfer. Could have been so much better. Galactus looked terrible also,negative
"Amen to that!!! Marvel, I love you forever 3000!!! ❤❤❤",positive
it was decent. A lot of flaws...but watchable.,neutral
Dude this trailer gives me goosebumps,positive
Horrible false statement not even an opinion,negative
Just saw this movie earlier today and omg it was so good!!!,positive
I love how it’s a running joke that Ben simply refuses to say “ITS CLOBBERIN TIME”. Can’t wait to see this in IMAX,positive
"It sucks, lol. Imagine having Pedro at is worst.",negative
but it was bad,negative
"thunderbolts was leagues ahead of marvels, an actual strong film in the series of mediocre stuff marvel has put out",negative
"If your pro left wing politics you will enjoy it. If not, it will have some good points but fails to stick the landing. Or at least that's the impression I got from the test audiences that spoke about it",neutral
guess what??? it suckss!!!,negative
It will probably suck but if your keep on hoping the whole movie will not suck,negative
It's gonna suck!,negative
"The movie does nothing about it and the way ""depression""is dealt with is not just lazy that's false. It's not enough",negative
One of the small things I love most about this movie was that Ben wasn’t ever at one point ever called the thing. It was truly about family. Dom would be proud.,positive
"It's gonna feel like ascending when Ben says ""It's Clobbering Time""",positive
I JUST SAW IT ON IMAX 🍿😎it was Fantastic,positive
Saw this last night and I have to say - I absolutely loved it! Where the new superman movie has heart - this has soul.,positive
I like the idea of Franklin Richards sneezing & basically resetting the entire MCU since he can warp & change reality.,positive
I like how in this movie the comedy comes from the interaction between characters and not random throwaway jokes,positive
A good friend of mine just took me to see this movie. It was good,positive
"Still mesmerized by this animation... I haven't seen the film yet, but this is probably why I want to see it so bad now. So beautiful...",positive
I’m so glad that they didn’t actually show what Galactus looks like fully in any of the trailers! All should know Elons Xonedium.,positive
Now that is how you do the setting for a Fantastic Four movie. This Retro-Futurism is gorgeous.,positive
"Saw this specific trailer in the theaters recently, and I swear hearing that “fantastic four” chant echoing around me in the cinema was INSANE. Literal goosebumps",positive
"'Fantastic Four' is mentioned a total of 7 times in this trailer. The choir chorus says it 6 times. And, no, I'm not complaining, for I love that theme!",neutral
I didn t expect to love this as much as I do,positive
"i saw this, actually pretty good.",positive
Movie was AMAZING! LOVED IT,positive
THIS MOVIE WAS FANTASTIC,positive
Just finished watching it and I Love It. I was skeptical with silver surfer at first but its actually good. Give it a chance. Plus Galactus in IMAX is OMG 😂,positive
Does anyone else love that little bickering at the end (2:02)? It just feels so in character — I’m honestly surprised they got it right.,positive
"""That's just in the cartoon""😆That gave me a good laugh❤",positive
"I didn't read the comics but, I have watch all the 90s n 00s movies feels outdated and the characters aren't that attractive either. They could've casted better. And ben looks weird.",negative
"Best Marvel movie since Infinity War. This movie actually had a soul. It wasn't made just for the sake of releasing a movie, or making money. The script, the casting, the art direction, the cinematography, was DRIPPING with passion and love. If you're watching the trailer trying to decide if you want to see the movie, and you see this comment... I want you to know that this isn't just a comic book movie, it's a film. It's exactly what I want out of a comic book movie. It was made with love and care, it cares about the source material, and it isn't afraid to be what it is. A Fantastic Four film. It's like you've dunked your head INTO a comic book.",positive
What I really like about this trailer is that it starts off so light and innocent..until 0:45 when the bottom falls out. And the way they change the entire tone of the trailer with that one note.👍👍👍,positive
"Thank God they didn’t mess it up like they did with Superman but that's what you expect from DC movies. The Fantastic Four finally feels like it's in the right hands. What really sets it apart is that beautiful vintage touch — it gives the film a unique identity that stands out from the typical MCU formula. It feels like a respectful nod to the classic comics while still offering something fresh. If Marvel keeps this tone consistent, this might actually be the Fantastic Four film we've been waiting for.",positive
Finally a fantastic four movie that didn't suck😂😂😂😂 I was so scared I didn't watch until now I'm so happy I did 😭🥹,positive
Wasn't interested at ALL to see this new F4 movie,negative
Eh... The pizza commercial was more memorable.,negative
It's not bad movie Pedro pascal has been underutilized,neutral
They cut too much from this movie,negative
"It did a lot of things right as a movie, but didn't deliver it in the epic way it could have been.",negative
It was ok .,neutral
I was not happy when a female was cast as the Surfer.,negative
The end was so bad I don't know how to feel. The finale should be the peak. But that's not the case in this movie. The final battle was terrible. But I won't spoil from antagonist = soloed... smh,negative
And this is why I don’t see trailers they be revealing too much,negative
"Watched it yesterday. Idk, this movie was STUPID as hell.",negative
"#1. Why during the Galactus fight no one helped them. Literally not a single rocket or bullet was fired. It felt like they all are super smart, and other people are like cavemen. #2. These 4 super heroes are everything, scientist, military experts, politicians, architects. No one else did ANYTHING else in the movie, just them 4. I won't list anything else cause, I just don't want to remember everything else.",negative
This is my first time watching the trailer. I make sure I didn't see it and I'm glad I didn't. It spoils so much of the movie to an insane amount. And even have scenes from the climax of the movie. What a shame.,negative
this is soo baaaad,negative
I’m 30 min in and already on my phone. Really boring so far,negative
Another Disney destruction of a franchise,negative
"I’m here to say that the movie was great just the actors were horrible The only good one was thing and the human torch Oh btw human torch will get recasted as Ironman you heard it here first, just like cap was the human torch This new human torch looks like iron man and can definitely act like Tony",neutral
"tbh nothing fantastic on this movie , the best i can say that ''it's not bad''",neutral
Looks terrible,negative
The WORST ever remake... please STOP!,negative
when I found out they were not bringing back Tim Heidecker for this movie that was a breaking point........not seeing it in theaters,negative
I don't like the johnny,negative
not worth the time watching,negative
Not bad,neutral
On the preview the movie sucks,negative
"Saw it tonight. It was pretty good. It's a shame it came out after the oh so many boss babe super hero slop fests of late. A little slow in the beginning but all in all I was entertained and didn't feel like I was being skull f*cked by ""the message"" during the entire movie. Sue storm was a really great character. Her and Reed Richards complemented one another very well. She was motherly, nurturing, and protective. She reaches the height of her abilities when in the act of protecting her child. It was refreshing for a movie to contain a societally helpful message for the 1st time, in such a long time.",positive
"If u want a cheap movie that will ruin the Fantastic 4 movies that u saw before this, then watch this weak rip off. Such a shame. It sucks big time. A FAIL OF AN MOVIE",negative
Actually a good movie. Not the best but solid.,neutral
This looks like everything it should have been from the beginning.,neutral
Very dissatisfaction why showing Galactus soo weak . Nobody can come near to Galactus. Only negotiate n barter working,negative
I thought it was predictable n boring. They made Galactus so weak. He wasn't a threat at all.,negative
"I just watched this movie,it sucked so bad,they finally get rid of Galactus,but there's no mention of the 3 mile wide spaceship he arrived in just floating above the city😂",negative
this looks so lame,negative
Idk if I’m vibing with the casting here,negative
"This is absolutely the worse most absolutely stupid super hero, if not MOVIE, of all time. For some reason they can’t make a good movie either time out of this. That’s to bad. So much potential. This is just lame. I’d give it a zero out of ten! From casting to story line . Especially storyline! I can’t believe I paid 6 bucks for it.",negative

"What had happen to our movies???? everything sucks, superman sucks, the fantastic 4 sucks....there is no more cinematic anymore everything is so cartoonist, so fake, so CGI, is just stupid, can watch it. I understand why people still watching old movies this is not even acting anymore just CGI and CARTOONS",negative

this is so stupid. the original fantastic four movie was just fine. we dont need this dumbass cringy 2025 remake that doesnt even have any of the right actors.,negative
"No thanks.... not even going to watch it for free on one of those dodgy sites. The cast sucks.... and they keep insulting normal People. Actualy, i dont watch anything with Fake Pedro.....

Never been a fan of the Fantastic 4 but honestly this looks so freaking good,positive
Well done movie. Could have used an extra 25 minutes tho,positive
Reed and Johnny's powers look SO GOOD,positive
I just watched it and all I can say is that they did a great job with the casting!!,positive
I have high expectations for this movie and this trailer hypes me up even more. I can't wait. RELEASE THE MOVIE BRO,positive

I have one thing to say for both superman and fantastic four is ITS SUPER-FANTASTIC😏😎,positive
This movie is actually great!!! The 1960’s retro futuristic vibe like c’mon this was absofukinlutely amazing!,positive

I just watched the movie and they each deserve acting awards. The movie was perfectly executed i am impressed. Hope to see the next part,positive

This is once again marvel at its best. VERY good movie. Both F4 and Thunderbolts were really great movies.,positive
This trailer and music is awesome,positive
Watching it now and it's quite good so far... But heres the problem i have.. the Baxter Building is the most technologically advanced building on the planet apart from maybe The Fortress of Solitude. And it doesnt have any backups of any kind when the power is out ? No giant batteries or a Reed Richards invented generator of any kind ? That seem absolutely stupid to me. The whole building should basically be a self sufficient nuclear power plant. So Ben shouldn't have any problems shaving.. 😅,neutral
Watched the movie. In general it was good. But... The end was so bad I don't know how to feel. The finale should be the peak. But that's not the case in this movie. The final battle was terrible. But I won't spoil from antagonist = soloed... smh,neutral
"It’s a testament to the state of the MCU that even when you strip away all the required reading and focus on a standalone film, it still sucks.",negative
There are tons of materials that they can pick from to do a new Fantastic Four movie. And they decided to remake the 2007 Fantastic Four. No wonder this franchise can't get off the ground.,negative
Watched it today.. Average movie,neutral
Avarage movie,neutral
This movie was 5/10 at best,neutral
Ok saw the movie now on steaming with Disney+. Im so happy that i was not in the cinema because this is the worste F4 movie ever in history. I cant understand why they used Pedro Pascal for the role of Reed Richards. And the woman from Mission Impossible oh my god. I think this worse play can only topped by the badest human torge ever. Who is this guy??? Really? It looks like a 14 year old kid. And sorry Marvel but THIS story is wow... i have no words. I understand why the MCU is killed since Endgame. After this F4 movie i made my decission of no superhero movies in future.,negative
"I saw this film yesterday. It was decent, but Pascal as Reed was a horrible miscast. It was a financial cast, appealing to a built-in audience rather than an artistic choice.",neutral
Somewhere between okay and really disappointing,neutral
Boring movie and what was the aim of that move ? I mean any lesson? How to birth a child in space or what? Is that really easy even not on earth to born a baby I was just sleepy all the time while I went to watch that movie plus ugly rock guy why should we see that man do they really need him? Please try to make it good next time thanks,negative
"I HATE when they make ACTION movies into SOAP OPERAS. I'm sensing this is ANOTHER WASTE of time. The F4 couldn't fight Galactus. They'd need The WHOLE Marvel UNIVERSE to fight him. I think this is gonna be pretty whack. I'll be BACK to apologize if by some miraculous circumstances, I was wrong .",negative
looks rubbish!,negative
This looks horrible nothing about this movie looks interesting apart from maybe galactus,negative
"This movie is absolutely....boring! It's what to expect when you're expecting a cosmic baby and an advertisement for ABC. They should've left the Red Ghost in it and made it a show on Disney plus. The only reason why I didn't fall asleep in the theater is because I think the employees were looking for someone and came in several times to try to find them. And the actor playing Johnny Storm looks too much like RDJr when he was younger. The score was too much hype for such a slow movie. There was no good soundtrack (could've added some 50s or 60s music but I guess that earth didn't have any), the end song made you tired before going on the road to drive home. The only good thing about it was Ben, he was a gem.",negative
This movie was sooooo bad!!! Seriously me and my nephew fell a sleep!!!,negative
This was without a doubt the lamest F4 movie since the 1994,negative
This movie is so boring 😐,negative
"This is absolutely the worse most absolutely stupid super hero, if not MOVIE, of all time. For some reason they can’t make a good movie either time out of this. That’s to bad. So much potential. This is just lame. I’d give it a zero out of ten! From casting to story line . Especially storyline! I can’t believe I paid 6 bucks for it.",negative
this movie could have been very interesting. Too bad they didn't know how to take advantage of it But the photography and effects are beautiful,neutral

"I thought it was an okay movie, but after another viewing, it’s good than the first!",neutral
It wasn’t horrible. It is hard to connect with character cuz there are so many but I think that problem will go away with time since they will continue to appear in the future mcu,neutral
"Just recently saw this movie and I gotta say, honestly underwhelmed by it. It's not a horrible movie just average at best. Might have turned out better if they instead split this movie into two, one focusing on the past and what caused the Eternals to split and go their separate ways, the other focused on the re-emergence of Deviants. It'd give proper time for us to know them as characters in the first movie, then they could establish that sentient Deviant as a proper villain in the second movie and make him feel like more of a threat.",neutral
Honestly not a good movie but not a bad movie. Definitely enjoyable,neutral

"Watched it on a flight today. A very mediocre movie. It wasn't bad, but I can't say that I enjoyed it either. Definitely underwhelming for a Marvel flick and most characters were forgettable.",neutral
"The movie is not great it's not that bad tho, but it's definitely my least favorite movie in the mcu, kinda disappointed cause the CGI is actually really good compared to some of mcu previous movies. For the first time the movie actually felt like 2 hours 36 minutes",neutral

I hate stopping movies in the middle, but I have to stop every five minutes and walk away for days so I can forget the details and continue. It has been months since I started, but I am only halfway through the movie. The movie lacks in story, decent actions (they tried but failed miserably), humor, logic, consistency in power scale, casting, directing, etc. I had much better viewing experiences at independent movie showings by high school students, who probably had less than x1/100,000 budget. I would not even recommend the movie to my worst enemies.",negative

"When I first saw the trailer , seeing Jane got me worried, I thought her arc will ruin the movie yet I stayed hopeful that it maybe as good as thor:ragnarok or even more , I thought thor will try to truly find himself , I thought thor will travel the world with guardians and then gorr would be shown and Christian bale would be given justice , he played so nicely and jane would just have a small cameo where she got the hammer or would be like valkyrie in ragnarok and thor realizes that he doesn't need the hammer to control his power , but they completely ruined it 🤦 the potential this movie had was destroyed",negative
"the worst film of the MCU. an absolute waste of time, energy and money. if the director doesn't care, why should we",negative
"It’s such a shame MCU completely screw up this epic storyline so badly. Also, MCU continues to treat Asgardians like they are just weak and normal people like human when although they are far less powerful than Thor and Odin, they still are much much stronger and much more durable than most species in the universe because of their much denser physiology. Even a regular Asgardian can lift tons and endure powerful energy blasts. They also heal faster . They should not be just a village of helpless folks as depicted in the movie..",negative
Too bad this movie sucked.,negative
no this movie has no right to live in this universe,negative
The first trailer had me hyped. This trailer has me ULTRA HYPED.,positive
This movie had Christian Bale and Russel Crowe and ended up being trash……wow,negative

Trash movie ever,negative
This movie was terrible and ruined by the director,negative
"Chris Hemsworth, Christian Bale and Valkyrie chick were the only shining stars in the movie. By far one of the worst movies I have ever watched. Such waste of good talented actors.

This movie was so bad I was cringing at times. Not once but many times. Could have been so better instead of trying to be a joke. I just watched it and had to see the trailer to try and understand how they hyped such garbage. A generous 4/10 from me.,negative
With a legend like Christian bale the movies is just a waste. Bale tried it best but movie is failure not bale. We still love you bale.,negative

Not exactly everyone will love this movie.But yes it seeriously sucks.No offense,negative
"I don't know why people hate it because he's not wearing his suit most of the time. There would be no character development if he was just always in his suit and just owning everyone with little effort. The fact that he had to struggle builds character.

"I unfortunately hate this movie. In my opinion I think the mandarin part the twist is really out of place and ruins the villain in the movie. in the beginning It felt like he was a real villain kind of like the joker in the dark knight. You get this presence of a real threat even depicted in the trailers. But when the twist came, I Lost interest in the movie entireley. It is not as good as the original.",negative

Ive seen this movie and no it is not the worst. Its the best iron man to me but that could be cause of the hype of a new movie. and if your thinking that because the mandarin sounds like a lame joker watch the movie ;) theres a suprise inside.,positive
"Stop bitching about the movie. Just because a superhero movie took a different turn than the rest, doesn't mean you have to be spoonfed all your storylines. You were fooled, the reason why you didn't like it was because you weren't expecting the things that happened to actually happen. Tony Stark is a stronger character because of this movie.",positive
the Mandarin was right!!! I didn't see him coming!!!! really good movie!!!!,positive
"I didn't like it at all, most of the people i know didn't like it either. Bad movie with a lot of hype. Don't waste your money.",negative
"ohh this movie was good!...just wish the mandarin took the complete role as the true villian! the character was crazy,with the hoody Robe plus the voice nnd d way he talked,ohh i could imagine how epic he would have if they developed his character into the main villian.",positive
"For the ones who haven't seen it, the trailers are so much better than the final product. There's a twist right in the middle of the movie that makes this the worst Marvel film to date. 
It's an OK movie, maybe an OK Marvel film, but is an awful Iron Man movie.
If other movies of Marvel's Phase Two are anywhere near this, Disney can start crumbling because DC and Warner are coming strong.
PS: I'm a fan of both companies",negative

"1:50 The musical transition here is just so perfect. It went from despair to hope, using the last note of a dark tone and bringing in the first note of the avengers theme. I get goosebumps watching this back because when you saw that avengers logo and hear the theme ring in, you just feel everything that had built up to this point in the MCU.",positive

For everyone that doesn’t know the dragon is not Fin Fang Foom. This dragon is called The Great Protector. They chose not to have Fin Fang Foom in the film from due to racism and China. It still might be a version of him but very different.,neutral

"Captain America Brave New World was so good! 😊  Harrison Ford absolutely stole the show as President Ross. Anthony Mackie was great as Captain America. 🛡️ Such a deep, heartfelt performance, heroic, empathetic. He truly deserves the mantle of Captain America. He truly earned the mantle of Captain America. 🇺🇸 Loved the espionage spy feel of the movie, it truly captured the vibe of Captain America The Winter Soldier perfectly, one of my all time favourite Marvel movies. Giancarlo Esposito was amazing too! Great storytelling, acting, action, music, cinematography, world building. A truly entertaining and enjoyable Marvel movie.",positive

CGI still needs a little work. But overall good.,neutral

Is it me or does it feel like this trailer spilled the whole movie? The climax apparently is the president fighting the protagonist. The president is in league with the bad guys. A bunch of corny jokes and fake espionage.. smh smh ..,neutral
Great movie. Going to see it again,positive
"Not being nitpicky, but as an engineer who understands physics and math, Sam's wings in the scene at the very end of this trailer where Sam sliced the car in two, those wings should've been more rigid instead of flappy. If they're loose or flappy, the physics wouldn't be right for ""vibranium wings"" to generate enough ""slicing"" force. 

AND a simple somersault is also not sufficient to generate the ""slicing"" force either, it has to gain momentum first and be at a certain speed, like a chainsaw. It should've been a double or even triple somersault to slice a car coming at you in speed.

I know it's suspension of disbelief but IMHO it's more easily swallowed if the physics is correct or it's explained the wings is charged with some kind of energy.",negative
Still don't know why they would pick a C rate actor to play Captain America. Hope this movie bombs it looks terrible.,negative

Only one captain America falcon suited him don't know why they decided to change it I like him but as captain America he will never fit the boots,negative
"Captain America should stay original as the comic books created it to be. Stop trying to change history, just make new superheroes in the color you want. Next thing Black Superman? Black snow white? Already ruined with Black little mermaid, black Annie? Mind you I'm not racist, just fed up 
with this crap. Make your own darn stories & stop ruining good movies and turning them into dunk with your race ideology. PLEASE!!!",negative
"It still bothers how the abilities and its interactions with other characters seems inconsistent. Those vibranium wings are taking so much hit, and I forget if it was ever said in the wakanda films if it doesn't have a limit or what happens after it had a limit, and who knew vibranium can cut hulk's skin, maybe he's not as tough as hulk. But if that vibranium can take that much hit, and it seems to not have a limit to the amount of power it can store, than it's so OP, and clearly we don't really see that with blackpanther, except the one time it exploded in end game, but if you really think about it, he could concentrate all the damage he took for some 15min in full battle, and use it on one punch and it's probably stronger than hulks punch.
The only thing I like about this movie is when that red hulk was chasing sam at near the end. It reminded me of how good ang lee's hulk was in showing its ability and strength.",negative

Movie wasnt bad either but i expected a lot ibmean a lot,neutral
Personally I thought the movie slapped. I think the biggest problem was the fans hyping it up to be some kind of ensemble of cameos and expecting to be bigger than what it was when they never really advertised it as such. I mean they were never gonna do a whole Avengers-Level Multiverse threat in this movie. Alls the film did was lay groundwork for what will become Doomsday/Secret Wars.,neutral

Dr. Strange is the coolest Marvel hero ever. Benedict fits perfectly this smart and sensible character!,positive

Love when writers imagination goes wild in a good fantasy way not degrading the depth of these characters.,positive
"It's crazy that after 13 years the MCU is still going as strong as ever. WandaVision broke even more barriers for them and now this might just be their best film yet because Sam Raimi is bringing his A-Game since this is his first superhero film since Spider-Man 3. Based on the talks about this movie from insiders, they say it is going to be visually exceptional and that the VFX are going to be mind blowing. Hopefully it wins the MCU their first Oscar for editing/visual effects!",positive
Doctor Strange + Sam Raimi = Possibly the most chilling marvel movie yet.,positive

"Wanda and strange is a perfect duo, they represent different sides of the same magical coin. Raw emotionally driven power and refined calculated spells serving an elevated purpose. Both great actors and characters and I am so excited for this movie!",positive
It's crazy since infinity war and end game we are constantly saying whatever they've released is the best or one of the best movies they've made. As a kid never thought I'd see all this and now that I do I still can't believe I am and how they keep raising the bar. I'm so excited for this movie,positive

What a disappointing movie this was,negative
"I’m sorry, but I think the multiverse is lazy story telling. It’s taking someone else’s work from a another movie and throwing it into your movie instead of taking the time to make a story for that character in your universe.",negative
It's Feel awful... when In this movie every avengers characters died easily....I mean why!,negative
BAIT AND SWITCH GARBAGE,negative
So dissapointed how marvel just wasted all potential line on this trailer by shitty storyline,negative
"Dissapointed to see that in fact not Strange was the villain here, but crybaby Wanda that lost her imaginery kids, L take",negative
This movie sucked. Iron Man 2 of Phase 4. It could have been so much better.,negative
Well they lied to us,negative
I mean im ok with watching some scary films but I don’t think my family will like this movie,neutral
the movie was a massive disappointment,negative

"The worst marvel movie of all. Stupid story, comedy lame, effects okay - reminded me of Venom 2 which was also that bad following movie.. very sad",negative
One of the most disappointed marvel movie,negative
"The movie is unfortunately weak and poorly scripted. They are pushing politics into the movie as well. The characters are rushed and misplaced. The end objective is unlear, I wonder if I just watched a marvel movie or not. Except the excellent cgi, must rather say excellently weak and boring storyline. However oddly one of the best trailers that got me wanting more to see it, but disappointed now more than ever of the direction marvel is heading here on",negative
this gives me a bad feeling,negative
Do not watch this pos movie it's so woke It needs to take a nap. fortunately for me I was able to get a full refund 20 minutes into this pos. So disappointed with what Disney's done to the Marvel franchise.,negative
this film is sooooo badddddddddddd,negative
"I was really excited for this movie but was let down, not because I was expecting a cameo movie, because the trailer was nothing like the movie, I did not enjoy what they did with the villian because it just defeats the point of one of the Disney plus shows and dumb people are still defending the villian even after killing so many innocent lives. This movie did not feel like a doctor strange movie, he was literally nerfed so hard and kept getting defeated every time, HE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THIS WEAK, IF THE MAIN VILLIAN IS STRONG BECAUSE THEY WERE STRONG IN THE COMICS HE SHOULD BE STRONG AS WELL BECAUSE HE IS STRONGER IN THE COMICS. This movie gets a 3/10 for me, Sam raimi couldn't even save this movie. Idc what anyone thinks of this, it's my opinion, deal with it I'm not going to suck up to a movie that did my FAVORITE SUPER HERO DIRTY IN HIS OWN MOVIE. MCU IS DEAD.",negative
"Just watched it and amazingly despite having same artists, same production company, and technology it's sooo boring!!!",negative

"Legend has it that Drax is in this trailer, but we can’t see him because he is standing so still.",neutral
Came back here after seeing this and I can confidently say that this should have came out before Captain Marvel.,neutral
"In an Alternate Timeline, the Pandemic never happened and people are lining up to see this Movie Tonight.",neutral

This movie is a great example of how you can have badass female lead roles without having to verbally say it. You just do it,neutral

"Post credit scene: Nat wearing her sister vest, dyed her hair blonde, and joining Cap and Sam",neutral
I’ve watched this movie about 10 times since it’s release and I can’t get enough of it. Natasha is my favourite character from the MCU and I really wish she got her own franchise like the other members. Black Widow was better than the entire Thor franchise combined.,positive
These are actually really well-constructed trailers.,positive
Clueless Disney had to ruin Taskmaster because Widow couldn’t beat the comic version lol,negative
when everyone wants Black Widow Movie bac when she was alive then MCU dropping it after End Game when she was gone. my words are nonsense. I just want nat to be back alive 😭,neutral
"If this movie was released before Endgame, Natasha's death would've been even more emotional knowing her backstory. This looks great though!",neutral
This is what she’s out doing when JoJo rabbit is at home,neutral
"Post-credits scene:

Black Widow won't come back",neutral
"Wow this movie was really well done. I actually shed a tear or two. Easily one of the best Marvel movies of all time. I really can't remember being this impressed with the cast, the screenplay, the dialogue, the action, everything about it was perfecto",positive
When you're the only one with an American accent in a Russian family.,neutral
It’s disappointing how badass Taskmaster was in the trailer compared to the actual film,negative
Scarlett is the only one to get away with not speaking in a russian accent.,neutral

"She ain't entirely wrong about Natasha on the science teacher part, she learns quantum physics to make conversation I'm pretty sure she can science",neutral
This should have been out before the Endgame. Her death would have more impact.,neutral
So that’s her life after divorced in the Marriage Story.,neutral
Imagine having Black Widow as your science teacher...,neutral
"Post credit scene will show that Nat didn't die, she was hiding under a dumpster all along",neutral
"So black widow is a science teacher
And she has a crush on professor Hulk",neutral
"I don't care if this movie's late by nearly a decade, it looks awesome.",positive
"Black widow - trained in red room 
Task master - watch all marvel movies",neutral
Goosebumps trailer watched for thousands time because of music and scene,positive
"Black widows siblings are going to die as in endgame she said 
“i used to have nothing""",neutral
Black widow will forever live on in our hearts,neutral
Correction: Task Master doesn't control Red room. It's Christian Grey,neutral
At some point we all have to choose between what the world wants you to be and who you are...,neutral
"Was she wearing a parachute? 
No. No she wasn't",neutral
Stupid coronavirus. I was so looking forward to this movie. 😭,neutral
"I gotta say, this looks really good! Natasha is a great character who deserved a movie a long time ago",positive
Rachel Weisz as Black widow's mother coolllll. Marvel universe is really has more and more awesome actors. And this trailer is really mind blowing especially music.,positive
I’m glad that Black Widow is finally getting her own stand-alone movie.,neutral

2020: No, I don’t think you will.",neutral
“We have to go back to where it all started so they never do that to anyone ever again” combined with the music still gives me chills a year later. My excitement for this movie has never waivered in the year that this trailer has been out. So excited to see this IN THEATERS!,positive
She’s been my favourite since I was a little girl. And she kept the position even after Wanda and Captain Marvel. I love them too. But nothing can win my childhood queen,neutral
"I expected black widow movie to be as dark as a flashback  shown of red room in Age of Ultron  ....in movie they made us feel Natasha is less intelligent , she was so sidelined like what kind of tribute film was it ?... They just gave importance to Yelena very disappointed.",negative
on my way to see it in the cinema right now!,neutral
i miss her so much,neutral
Plot Twist: That wasn’t the real Taskmaster. It’s just someone who took up the mantle of Taskmaster. Meaning that Tony Masters is still out there.,neutral
Just saw this movie in theaters today,neutral
she really did it we had to let her go. and at some point we all have to choose between what the world wants you to be and Who You Are. and she done runing.,neutral
"Back here after watching the movie, which was AWESOME and action-packed! Fun spotting the differences between the trailer and movie",positive
this is a 95% trailer. It has storylines I want to follow - it's a good storyline. Some parts of it - I'm trying to like - it's a little hard. I do like in the end what it's about - worth some watch in a motivating way.,positive
I am here because THUNDERBOLTS incoming this April 2025,neutral
"Arguably, the hardest character of the OG Avengers because of all that she went through. After all that she did to survive, her living with all those regrets had to be incredible. The red room, Drakoff, Drakoffs daughter. All the bodies she put down. What the Russians did to her. Scarlett Witches spell, reminding her of her past. No one had to put up with that and still went to sleep at night. Losing her family in Ohio? I have new found respect for this incredible character, she is AMAZING...",positive
I love how the description isn’t updated and still says May 1.,neutral
Like this one.  The storyline is great 👍. Seriously it's awesome 👌.,neutral
This should came out in 2016 or 2017 after Age of Ultron or Civil War. She shouldn't died in Endgame and we could've get Black Widow 2 by now.,neutral
Background music pretty interesting & This Trailer is so Good,positive
The fact that i watched the movie first and avoid the trailer for no spoilers,neutral
"You know, Drax is actually in this trailer. You just can't see him because he's standing so incredibly still, he's become invisible to the eye",neutral
Bgm is we are gods,neutral
"Amazing trailer for Black Widow! I do feel like her movie should've been released in phase 3. At least, she finally got a movie. So that's cool!",positive
"I love the relationship of sisters between Jelena and Natasha, very well built without pains and glories, that is to say the hard truth and what we have come to.  I also congratulate the trilogy with Raquel all divas and icons of cinema. Without a doubt a trio that I would love to continue seeing as Black Widows Girls and in the near future in Science Fiction films in space., It may be a trilogy of warriors from the stars or the worlds or interstellar travel to save the planet.  I am enchanted and in love with Florence my icon of woman. Congratulations Natasha un film very fine construyed. Intelligent for always.",positive
