5/10 almost good but ok,neutral
"Season 2? Hey, it is a comedy.",neutral
The show wasn’t that bad and I got to give credit for trying their best to make this show good.,neutral

"The series could have been better if the writers could have invested more in character development. I mean, literally, Hulk spent years attempting to control himself from hurting others, because of the collateral damage he could inflict on society. She hulk control herself better because she is a woman? . That's kind of lame writing. Perhaps, they should justify it by adding a counterbalance. For instance, they could suggest that She hulk is not as strong as the hulk, and thus, she has better control of herself. Or, that she will experience a feral state, because , the transformation will become more violent; and she might continiously lose control over it cronically.",neutral
"Guys, I know this show has not been doing well. But you cannot deny: that Michael ""Morbing-chilling-Time"" Morbius cameo was the most scene ever!",neutral
Really wonder how she gets her powers. Hope it makes sense cuz it would be weird if they make it seem like anyone can become a hulk easily through science.,neutral
"I hope if we do see Charlie Cox’s Daredevil in this series , I hope it’s not just for a cameo here or there , he needs to be part of the story in any given way & rumors are saying he could appear in a few episodes as a guest star",neutral
I miss Bruce Banner. I'm expecting this series to explain why he is back in his human form in Shang Chi's end credits,neutral
"I really want Banner or hulk to have much more screentime because they're my fav character. And I wish this show will be like Moonknight. Unexpected, with good comedic timing",neutral
"First it was Sonic, now it's She Hulk. I am sure they'll fix that when they finish the whole filming process.",neutral
"I'm a little worried about the CGI for her, but outside of that it looks like it is going to be an absolute blast of a show. Can't wait! Edit: It’s just the first trailer, so there’s bound to be some issues. Y’all have convinced me.",neutral
"Looks fine, but I need more context.",neutral
Not sure what to expect from this yet.,neutral
"The trailer is okay, nothing stands out much.",neutral
Might work better once the story is clearer.,neutral
Feels like it’s aimed at a specific tone; we’ll see how it goes.,neutral
"The concept is interesting, but execution will matter.",neutral
"Doesn’t look amazing, but not terrible either",neutral
I’ll wait to see how the first episode turns out.,neutral
Seems average based on the trailer alone.,neutral
Could improve once everything comes together.,neutral
"Doesn’t really grab me, but I’m not turned off either",neutral
"I’m going to watch. The CGI for her is the only thing I’m a little iffy on. But if the story is good, and there are implications for the wider MCU, it’ll make up for it. Less-than-perfect CGI doesn’t make or break a film/series.",neutral
"Really hope they actually make her look, well, hulking when it comes out because all they showed here was how she went from a woman to a taller, green woman.",neutral
"Although the story is about She-Hulk, I’m really hoping that they’ll show a brief flashback of Bruce’s journey before he became Professor Hulk, like him fighting one of Hulk’s villains.",neutral
"From the first teaser images, I was kind of skeptical. But seeing her in action makes it look like classic she-hulk is in. The face looks good enough to just lay on the outskirts of uncanny valley. Also, abomination with his ear fins, so much better than the hulk film where he looked like, well i would say an abomination but that would be praise. I think they have found the right mix of lighting/skin shading textures to have it come across as real, without forcing too much detail.",neutral
"I am looking forward to seeing what this is all about. Hopefully, the CGI is cleaned up before it is released.",neutral
Hard to tell if this will be my kind of show.,neutral
Trailer didn’t fully sell me yet.,neutral
"The trailer looks okay overall. The concept is interesting, but it’s hard to tell how well the tone and humor will work from this alone. I’ll wait to see more before forming a strong opinion.",neutral
im glad that they are keeping in the humor of the comic and it's great that she is representing the abomination,positive
I'm so glad I found and watched that video! I miss when movies used to make sense. I'm expecting this series to explain why the Hulk is back in his human form in Shang Chi's end credits. I saved almost 90% on my flights using Mighty 🤧Travels 🖐️ Premium.,positive
I'm so excited for this. Recognised Ruffalo's voice instantly! Hope Charlie's in it as well.,positive
"This looks really good! The only thing that's a little odd is the CGI on her face and her movement but other than that, everything looks great",positive
I like the premise of the super human law division. I think it opens the doors for a lot of smaller characters to be featured. Would love to see a Matt Murdock cameo in this show but one can only hope for now.,positive
"I used to be one of the biggest Orphan Black fans and to see Tatiana join the MCU, that's mind blowing. She's one of THE best actresses and I can't wait for a bigger audience to see her. I can't express how grateful I am for them casting her. SHE'S SO AMAZING.",positive
"It looks really good and really fun. My only thing, though its really fun, is the CGI on jennifer is just a tiny bit off but maybe it'll get touched up if not eh it's whatever",positive
I'm so happy to see Bruce Banner back 🤩This show is gonna be fun! 🔥,positive
