review,sentiment
this movie could have been very interesting. Too bad they didn't know how to take advantage of it But the photography and effects are beautiful,neutral
"Not a bad movie. Not Marvel’s best, but a good 2 hour time sink. Can’t believe the voice actor for Clank in the Ratchet and Clank games voices Arishem the Judge in this!",neutral
I’m not a marvel fan but I thought this movie was ok,neutral
"I thought it was an okay movie, but after another viewing, it’s good than the first!",neutral
It wasn’t horrible. It is hard to connect with character cuz there are so many but I think that problem will go away with time since they will continue to appear in the future mcu,neutral
"Just recently saw this movie and I gotta say, honestly underwhelmed by it. It's not a horrible movie just average at best. Might have turned out better if they instead split this movie into two, one focusing on the past and what caused the Eternals to split and go their separate ways, the other focused on the re-emergence of Deviants. It'd give proper time for us to know them as characters in the first movie, then they could establish that sentient Deviant as a proper villain in the second movie and make him feel like more of a threat.",neutral
Honestly not a good movie but not a bad movie. Definitely enjoyable,neutral
"This movie is too overhated, it wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst",neutral
For me I rate it 5.5 out of 10,neutral
It was alright. Imo one of the better phase 4 marvel movies.,neutral
"I saw the movie, it's not the best or the worst but I enjoyed the humor",neutral
"I watched Eternals on disney plus. Not as bad as people say it is. I def think there's worse marvel movies out there. I loved how unique and informative this movie was for the entire MCU, although in overall, I don't think the movie was amazing.",neutral
"Nice scenery, good music, no Story. It was ok.",neutral
"Watched it on a flight today. A very mediocre movie. It wasn't bad, but I can't say that I enjoyed it either. Definitely underwhelming for a Marvel flick and most characters were forgettable.",neutral
"The movie is not great it's not that bad tho, but it's definitely my least favorite movie in the mcu, kinda disappointed cause the CGI is actually really good compared to some of mcu previous movies. For the first time the movie actually felt like 2 hours 36 minutes",neutral
Mid movie,neutral
Temu Avengers,negative
"This movie definitely had many flaws, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I hope they keep the eternals and make more films with them in it",neutral
"This is the most mid movie i've seen, wasted my time lol.",neutral
Movie is fine even if not the best,neutral
