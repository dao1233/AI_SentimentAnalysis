"Not that the movie was bad, it just had every opportunity to become something insane like the trailer promised us. And it just wasn't.",neutral
This movie could have been better.,
"Trailer was a 5/5, Movie barely a 3.5/5",
"I'm so conflicted, getting real hyped just hearing Patrick Stewart again but I really don't want mutants to just exist because Multiverse Magic. I can feel the Sam Raimi coming off in this trailer and I love it",
"The movie was okay, the trailer had me fooled, the music is awesome, can't wait for the next Doctor Strange movie to come out!",
Sure the movie was OKAY,
Average movie,
"It wasn't that bad 5,8/10 ",
"5,8/10 is neither good nor bad. The movie is neither good nor bad but it's a bad score for a movie, especially this one",
Movie wasnt bad either but i expected a lot ibmean a lot,
Personally I thought the movie slapped. I think the biggest problem was the fans hyping it up to be some kind of ensemble of cameos and expecting to be bigger than what it was when they never really advertised it as such. I mean they were never gonna do a whole Avengers-Level Multiverse threat in this movie. Alls the film did was lay groundwork for what will become Doomsday/Secret Wars.,
"According to me the movie was over hyped, it didn't deserve that title. the movie wasn't like bad",
"This is a fun popcorn movie. Other than that, it is egregiously mid.",
"This movie is pretty mid, but whoever cut this trailer did an exceptional job.",
"After seeing the movie, it just felt weird and I expected so much better. It wasn’t bad, I midly enjoyed it but probably one of my least favorite marvel movies.",
"cgi is not bad, story does not make sense, still a fun film with good actors. 6/10 not a bad film",
"It wasn't a bad movie per se, but everyone thought it's a continuation of his actions from No Way Home.",
Not bad....MCU are still not done yet.,
mid tier movie though,
Mid movie,
