review,sentiment
I honestly hope they can do a Winter Soldier solo film or something to that effect in the future. Kinda like what they did with Bourne Legacy. A spinoff of the Captain America films where they take an equally badass character in The Winter Soldier and have him go up against his own villains and such.👍👍,positive
trailer looked way cooler than the actual show.,positive
"I'm loving this show, so far. The character development is what makes it so good. I hope they continue with marvel, live action, shows.",positive
one of the best trailer cuts. woow the show was amazing too loved it,positive
Sebastian in SO HOT in this. Bucky is great written and acted. Hats off!,positive
I’m actually kind of excited Sharon Carter is getting another chance in these movies. The actress is amazing and she was a cool character in the comics,positive
Really glad they didn't scrap Agent 13. I liked Emily in that role.,positive
"Great series, I never thought series can be such action packed, sad it's ended. After Finale !",positive
"Marvel is successful in casting Anthony and Sebastian, they have the chemistry.",positive
"This show is so good. I got up in the middle of the night so I could watch each episode as soon as they came out, I listen to the soundtrack, and I've watched the episodes more than a hundred times in total. This show means so much to me, and one of my biggest wishes is that Marvel would make a season two. But if they don't put Bucky in Captain America 4 I will have an existential crisis and cry for weeks. Bucky has been a big part in each of the Cap movies so far, and just because we have a new Cap, it doesn't mean that they can change that.",positive
This show is beast. I like how they Marvel made it for Adult audience with language & enemies that were defeated was great screen play!,positive
Damm man. This is one of the best shows i have ever watched. Need more shows like this .,positive
im addicted to trailer coming here again and again😎🔥🔥🔥,positive
"For disney and MCU, are you sure this is series?? Feels like a movie for me. The quality of this trailer is WOOOOWWW!!!!",positive
If you have not seen this series. It is extremely well done. It starts good and gets better as you watch it so the satisfaction level is high. Thank you for making this series Marvel. You need to do a second season of this show.,positive
"Back when these shows were at least memorable😢 I can’t remember anything that has happened in Ms marvel, moonknight was ok, but watch this and then She-Hulk. I bet anyone who doesn’t know marvel will have no idea they are made by the same company",negative
"I loved this just as much as WandaVision. Sam’s and Bucky dynamic and relationship was amazing, Baron Zemo coming back was cool, Karli was a good antagonist imo and Episode 5 is so gut wrenching and emotional. I give it a 8/10",positive
I’m really disappointed he’s not called Captain Falcon.,negative
"Hell yeah it was a 10/10 for me. I kinda rlly hated the new captain america but then he had character development on the last ep, also zemo. Bucky, Sebastian, my husband was amazingg",positive
"Such an overhated show, yh there's flaws but it's not bad. The bucky nerf yh it's weird, the villain was forgettable and falcon does have some off lines but the rest was solid, Falcon and Bucky's beef made sense and the development of their relationship was great.",neutral
I hate new captain America,negative
After watching all episodes... Here are the things... Falcon usless one.. Bucky it was your hand.. and fortunetlly had no idea to cut it off but his soldier had.. Marvel at the end so predictable and have become unworthy.. guys making mony was different thing ..now you all are becoming greedy . Soon DC universe will be a game changer ... But would like to know.. you fools likes to fool..and we are fools...,negative
Weak! The hype is not real. Bring back Daredevil.,negative
New captain America are you kidding me bro🫥,negative
"I was so excited to see this series but when I saw they replaced captain america “Cris Evans” with some new guy, it was such a turning event. That new guy is a disaster no offence but marvel shouldn’t have given him the shield. Hope this character won’t last long.😪",negative
"Worst captain America ever. He’s a good actor though because he obeys the government really well. Steve was about doing the right thing, not just obeying orders. He actually had a brain. This show is a huge disappointment and I’m only on episode 3….",negative
Such a bad series . It completly assassinated the concepts of Captain America. It also feels like a twiter post made into a tv series.,negative
This show was terrible. Should have retired the shield.,negative
"I can't watch marvel movies anymore because Chris Evans is not Capitan America anymore,and Iron Man is not Robert Downey Jr. Don't replaced them.",negative
There's so much programming in programming. Boring AF to watch anymore. Aren't people SICK of division already??,negative
"Mannnn, this trailer music doesn't fit the vibe of the series",negative
I give this series a 5/10,neutral
"There are some things that I hate about this series. One bringing the US agent into the MCU(that was not good) and letting him have the shield of Capt was idiotic. I thought Sam Wilson would get the shield, but they made this. Second Sharon working for some illegal organisation doesn't make any sense. Third adding this stupidest group called the flag smashers and creating more super serums was toooooo much. This series makes anybody vomit.",negative
"This sucked so bad, bucky is a beast in the movie ""winter soldier"" and then gets handed by a kid who has serrum but no fighting experience -__- And then they got to bring race into it 🙄jeez this was plain WHACK",negative
terrible trailer honestly,negative
This show is absolutely Terrible !!!!,negative
"50% good stuff, 50% Woke trash. I watched it till the end because I loved Walker & Lemar.",neutral
I feel Bucky is quite underplayed in this. He had given cap such a hard time in Winter Soldier. He is much more a stronger guy than shown in Episode 2. I'm kind of disappointed.,negative
This show was pretty mediocre with very outdated ideologies. Karli and the super soldiers plotline was very weak and made no sense. Worst villain ever. The fighting choreography was worse than age of ultron and the only good scenes were where Sam and bucky argued and every scene with Zemo and John. I'll rate it either a 6.5/10 or 7/10,neutral
"I finished watching chapter 6, at every moment you can sense what is going to happen and the background ""message"", more boring than looking at the wall. big NO NO",negative
The Series is a waste of time ! Pathetic story !!,negative
"I absolutely hate rap ""music ""!!..Garbage!!.😡😖!!",negative
these films are so badly made im sorry but its 2021 u can do better than this!,negative
"Man thank god i didnt pay money and go see this , they've totally killed captain america . marvel wtf is with these split episodes crap",negative
"Bucky should have been Captain America. Also, they made Bucky look SO weak in this series to not over-do Falcon.",negative
It's not that good. The fight scenes especially the kicks and punches look fake.,neutral
"I hate this series. It's racially charged, anti-American, anti-white, politically correct. They went backwards to tell the story of a Black man who was Captain America in the 1950s and apparently treated harshly by the Government, yadda, yadda, yadda.",negative
