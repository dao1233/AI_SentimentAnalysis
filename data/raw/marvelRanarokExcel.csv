review,sentiment
8 years later and still one of MARVEL’s best teaser trailers.,positive
Crazy how the line “he is a friend from work” came from a make-a-wish kid that was visiting the set while they were shooting the movie. The kid said “you should say he is a friend from work when you see him” and boom. Its in the movie. Crazy.,positive
Whoever designed this trailer needs an Oscar or a promotion,positive
"Let’s admit, this is the best trailer out of any mcu movie",positive
The music makes this trailer like 100x more awesome,positive
Led Zeppelin makes everything better. True fact,positive

The real question is will the janitor be worthy enough to clean up the pieces?,neutral

I'm here after thor love and thunder just to remind myself when thor was awesome...,negative
Man this still holds up even after watching the movie.,positive
"It’s well intentioned but ultimately numbing, an instance of fun overkill whose ultimate goal seems to be to put us into a special-effects coma. Not even the occasional inspired touch can save it.",negative
It certainly coordinated things well to leave impressions. The trailer takes careful pains to underline just how impossible it will be to stop Hela by normal superhero methods.,positive
"Thor throws Mjolnir and Hela just catches it headfirst. As ""The Immigrant Song""'s intro ramps up the tension, she makes a pants-wetting display of power by calmly, slowly gripping her bare fingers around the Uru relic tight enough to shatter it; her face never tenses or even changes expression from that bemused smirk. At the moment the magic contained within explodes outward, the real melody and action starts.",positive
"Honestly, the teaser was better than the trailer.",negative
yeah a lot of things in the trailer didn't actually happened in the movie.,negative
I did! I went to opening night last night and saw it! It was awesome! I was so happy to hear this song in the movie twice,positive
This trailer is some kind of brain poison. I am addicted and watching it all day.,positive
"Not saying this trailer is bad at all, but going into the theatre without knowing anything really payed off",neutral
"Jek well, it wouldn't matter cause a lot of the stuff in the trailer is either different or didn't show up at all. But yeah I think watching the movie before the trailer is more exciting but I can't ever skip a trailer by marvel.",neutral
"""YES! We know each other from work!"" This is why I've been waiting for a year for this movie....",positive
2019 and this is still one of the best teaser trailers.,positive
"""WE KNOW EACHOTHER, HE'S A FRIEND FROM WORK!"" Thor, Thor I love you.",positive
I don't remember the last time I've rewatched a single trailer this many times.,positive
Well this trailer just came out of no where,neutral
Hulk's Armor isn't needed. It's like covering a tank with cloth.,negative
Did you notice how hela break Thor's hammer in 2 different places? One place in trailer another place in movie!!!,neutral
This trailer is damn near perfect. Whoever cut this together deserves all the awesome. I haven't liked a trailer this much since Watchmen.,positive
Cate Blanchett looks like a completely different person with that makeup and hair she looks 20 years younger and its HOT! that smile while she's holding his rock hard hammer and then destroys its a HUGE turn on,positive
i legit dont understand why they cut this bit out. It would have been so cool to see that,negative
