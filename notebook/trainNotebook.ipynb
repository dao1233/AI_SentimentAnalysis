If you're watching the trailer trying to decide if you want to see the movie, and you see this comment... I want you to know that this isn't just a comic book movie, it's a film. It's exactly what I want out of a comic book movie. It was made with love and care, it cares about the source material, and it isn't afraid to be what it is. A Fantastic Four film. It's like you've dunked your head INTO a comic book.\", 'What I really like about this trailer is that it starts off so light and innocent..until 0:45 when the bottom falls out.

The Fantastic Four finally feels like it's in the right hands. What really sets it apart is that beautiful vintage touch — it gives the film a unique identity that stands out from the typical MCU formula. It feels like a respectful nod to the classic comics while still offering something fresh.

The cast sucks.... and they keep insulting normal People. Actualy, i dont watch anything with Fake Pedro..... By the way.... central América and some of the south were colonized by the Spanish..... so.... Pedro.... you are a Colonizer And your family probably owned American Indian slaves and slauther them for gold', 'Brooooo This Movie is Trash', 'Never been a fan of the Fantastic 4 but honestly this looks so freaking good', 'Well done movie.

Loved every second. I love when superhero stuff has great emotional depth and acting. 10/10❤❤❤', 'Are we not going to talk about this fantastic score as well?

But heres the problem i have.. the Baxter Building is the most technologically advanced building on the planet apart from maybe The Fortress of Solitude.

The whole building should basically be a self sufficient nuclear power plant. So Ben shouldn't have any problems shaving.. 😅\", \"Watched the movie. In general it was good. But...

Average movie', 'Avarage movie', 'This movie was 5/10 at best', 'Ok saw the movie now on steaming with Disney+. Im so happy that i was not in the cinema because this is the worste F4 movie ever in history. I cant understand why they used Pedro Pascal for the role of Reed Richards. And the woman from Mission Impossible oh my god. I think this worse play can only topped by the badest human torge ever. Who is this guy??? Really? It looks like a 14 year old kid. And sorry Marvel but THIS story is wow... i have no words. I understand why the MCU is killed since Endgame. After this F4 movie i made my decission of no superhero movies in future.', 'I saw this film yesterday. It was decent, but Pascal as Reed was a horrible miscast. It was a financial cast, appealing to a built-in audience rather than an artistic choice.', 'Somewhere between okay and really disappointing', 'Boring movie and what was the aim of that move ? I mean any lesson? How to birth a child in space or what? Is that really easy even not on earth to born a baby I was just sleepy all the time while I went to watch that movie plus ugly rock guy why should we see that man do they really need him? Please try to make it good next time thanks', \"I HATE when they make ACTION movies into SOAP OPERAS. I'm sensing this is ANOTHER WASTE of time. The F4 couldn't fight Galactus.

It's what to expect when you're expecting a cosmic baby and an advertisement for ABC. They should've left the Red Ghost in it and made it a show on Disney plus. The only reason why I didn't fall asleep in the theater is because I think the employees were looking for someone and came in several times to try to find them. And the actor playing Johnny Storm looks too much like RDJr when he was younger. The score was too much hype for such a slow movie. There was no good soundtrack (could've added some 50s or 60s music but I guess that earth didn't have any), the end song made you tired before going on the road to drive home.

They could 've casted better . And ben looks weird .\", \"Best Marvel movie since Infinity War . This movie actually had a soul . It was n't made just for the sake of releasing a movie , or making money . The script , the casting , the art direction , the cinematography , was DRIPPING with passion and love . If you 're watching the trailer trying to decide if you want to see the movie , and you see this comment ... I want you to know that this is n't just a comic book movie , it 's a film . It 's exactly what I want out of a comic book movie . It was made with love and care , it cares about the source material , and it is n't afraid to be what it is . A Fantastic Four film . It 's like you 've dunked your head INTO a comic book .\", 'What I really like about this trailer is that it starts off so light and innocent .. until 0:45 when the bottom falls out . And the way they change the entire tone of the trailer with that one note.👍👍👍', \"Thank God they didn ’ t mess it up like they did with Superman but that 's what you expect from DC movies . The Fantastic Four finally feels like it 's in the right hands . What really sets it apart is that beautiful vintage touch — it gives the film a unique identity that stands out from the typical MCU formula . It feels like a respectful nod to the classic comics while still offering something fresh . If Marvel keeps this tone consistent , this might actually be the Fantastic Four film we 've been waiting for .\", \"Finally a fantastic four movie that did n't suck😂😂😂😂 I was so scared I did n't watch until now I 'm so happy I did 😭🥹\", \"Was n't interested at ALL to see this new F4 movie\", 'Eh ...

Why during the Galactus fight no one helped them . Literally not a single rocket or bullet was fired . It felt like they all are super smart , and other people are like cavemen . # 2 .

I wo n't list anything else cause , I just do n't want to remember everything else .\", \"This is my first time watching the trailer . I make sure I did n't see it and I 'm glad I did n't .

Really boring so far', 'Another Disney destruction of a franchise', 'I ’ m here to say that the movie was great just the actors were horrible The only good one was thing and the human torch Oh btw human torch will get recasted as Ironman you heard it here first , just like cap was the human torch This new human torch looks like iron man and can definitely act like Tony', \"tbh nothing fantastic on this movie , the best i can say that `` it 's not bad ''\", 'Looks terrible', 'The WORST ever remake ... please STOP !', 'when I found out they were not bringing back Tim Heidecker for this movie that was a breaking point ........ not seeing it in theaters', \"I do n't like the johnny\", 'not worth the time watching', 'Not bad', 'On the preview the movie sucks', \"Saw it tonight . It was pretty good . It 's a shame it came out after the oh so many boss babe super hero slop fests of late . A little slow in the beginning but all in all I was entertained and did n't feel like I was being skull f * cked by `` the message '' during the entire movie . Sue storm was a really great character . Her and Reed Richards complemented one another very well . She was motherly , nurturing , and protective .

The whole building should basically be a self sufficient nuclear power plant . So Ben should n't have any problems shaving .. 😅\", \"Watched the movie . In general it was good . But ...

Im so happy that i was not in the cinema because this is the worste F4 movie ever in history . I cant understand why they used Pedro Pascal for the role of Reed Richards .

And sorry Marvel but THIS story is wow ... i have no words . I understand why the MCU is killed since Endgame . After this F4 movie i made my decission of no superhero movies in future .', 'I saw this film yesterday . It was decent , but Pascal as Reed was a horrible miscast .

It 's what to expect when you 're expecting a cosmic baby and an advertisement for ABC . They should 've left the Red Ghost in it and made it a show on Disney plus . The only reason why I did n't fall asleep in the theater is because I think the employees were looking for someone and came in several times to try to find them . And the actor playing Johnny Storm looks too much like RDJr when he was younger . The score was too much hype for such a slow movie . There was no good soundtrack ( could 've added some 50s or 60s music but I guess that earth did n't have any ) , the end song made you tired before going on the road to drive home .
