ve created is marvelous', '1000th like', 'its GLORIOUS', 'Man this still holds up even after watching the movie', 'It certainly coordinated things well to leave impressions The trailer takes careful pains to underline just how impossible it will be to stop Hela by normal superhero methods', 'Thor throws Mjolnir and Hela just catches it headfirst As The Immigrant Song s intro ramps up the tension she makes a pants wetting display of power by calmly slowly gripping her bare fingers around the Uru relic tight enough to shatter it her face never tenses or even changes expression from that bemused smirk At the moment the magic contained within explodes outward the real melody and action starts', 'I did I went to opening night last night and saw it It was awesome I was so happy to hear this song in the movie twice', 'This trailer is some kind of brain poison I am addicted and watching it all day', 'YES We know each other from work This is why I ve been waiting for a year for this movie',

times', 'This trailer is damn near perfect Whoever cut this together deserves all the awesome I haven t liked a trailer this much since Watchmen', 'Cate Blanchett looks like a completely different person with that makeup and hair she looks 20 years younger and its HOT that smile while she s holding his rock hard hammer and then destroys its a HUGE turn on', 'I m sorry but whoever made the trailer song is a genius Combining yellow brick road by Elton John with the Loki theme was brilliant composing Hats off to them', 'Whoever came up with the song and the trailer deserve a big raise', 'This has the potential to be the best of the Ant Man movies', 'Even if the movie itself was far from the best Marvel movie this was one of the best Marvel trailers imo Even after watching the movie I still get chills from this trailer', 'Jonathan Majors is such a great actor I m so glad he s getting his role fully enveloped within the MCU', 'I love how Kang sounds so calm yet at the same time so terrifying', 'I love how Scott says that the people who adores him often calls him as Spider Man by mistake while the Next Big Bad that is Kang knows that he s the one and only Ant Man', 'I see this trailer almost everyday because I work at a movie theater and it never fails to amaze me', 'Can we take a moment to appreciate the VFX artists The visuals are stunning', 'The buildup to more comic book accurate suits is phenomenal Can t wait', 'I m obsessed with Jonathan Majors as Kang The guy is phenomenal and clearly puts everything he has into his roles Very excited to see what he brings to the role over the next several years', 'I can already tell that Majors is gon na absolutely kill it as Kang This is gon na be amazing', 'It s wild how even in just this short clip you can tell that this version of Kang has an entirely different aura about him than the He Who Remains version in Loki Really looking forward to Jonathan s performances with the character', 'I love the part where Kang goes It s you Ant man the Wasp Quantumania', 'Kang s lines in this trailer are giving me chills Jonathan Majors is going to give one hell of a performance here I m so excited', 'The trailer and the song go together perfectly', 'Round of applause for the composer who blended Elton John s Goodbye Yellow Brick Road into the Loki theme and then back out into Yellow Brick Road Beautifully done', 'I love how vastly different He Who Remains and Kang the Conqueror are Just from their speaking tones you can tell how different they are HWR is more joyous and playful especially when he still held the cards Kang is more proud in his speaking it has a sort of power like he knows he more powerful than whoever he talks to and his speaking is so cold too Jonathan Majors is an amazing actor', 'The quantum realm looks so beautiful', 'This looks awesome Everything about it seems so disconnected from everything we ve already seen in the mcu almost like a guardians vibe it almost feels like a standalone scifi movie', 'Casting Jonathan Majors as Kang was such a great idea He s a truly talented upcoming actor He s just got that swag someone would need to be the next Thanos level villain', 'Really excited to see Jonathan Majors play Kang He did extremely well as he who remains and I can already tell he s gon na deliver with this one too', 'Love that they turned this into a family adventure', 'I think this movie has a bright future', 'I think Antman has one of the best and most consistent story arcs in the MCU I love it', 'The amount of goosebumps this gave me is surreal Mavel

receptionist', 'this movie has a ton of potential and this trailer looks insane im so hyped', 'The cinematography and the visuals in this film are insane Hats off to Marvel', 'I love it when Scott

incredible screen presence There s a special aura to him every time he appears in something He looks great as Kang The Conqueror a villain who I ve been waiting to see adapted for a long time I m very happy for the success he s having', 'Even thought the movie was controversial the trailers were phenomenal', 'What I love about Kang is that he has no powers is no strong alien or something else He is just smart and one of the biggest threats in the Marvel Universe I just love that', 'It may be just me but I love how they were to pull it off and give Kang his iconic face even though it may be a mask he wears while traveling', 'Is it just me or this movie has that guardians of the galaxy feel with all of the aliens and beautiful imagery and the song just fits i m so excited for this movie', 'Can t wait for Spider Man and the Wasp Quantumania Looks really good Also glad that they gave Scott Lang some role too he s heavily underrated', 'So excited to see Jonathan majors back his portrayal of he who remains was amazing and can t wait to see him as Kang', 'the musical score of this trailer is off the charts i love it', 'I ve always felt like the Ant Man movies are super underrated I m very excited for this next one', 'Even from a few seconds in this trailer you can see Jonathan Majors incredible range His comedic demeanour in Loki is SO different to the stoic aloof kinda vibe he s giving off here I ve literally seen this man act in one episode of a show and a 2 minute trailer and I m already blown away by him', 'I really enjoy the retro futuristic instrumental in this trailer It definitely ties back to Loki through the music', 'That first scene was incredibly epic Seeing Kang gave me chills They might be skimping on CGI on Disney to save money but I m relieved to see they aren t pulling punches with the CGI here Looks incredible Really looking forward to this', 'I love the Spiderman franchise so hyped for this next instalment of it', 'This movie looks like it ll have major effects on the MCU big picture wise I m so excited to see Jonathan Majors again He s so charismatic and I love that we ll be seeing different versions of Kang', 'I seriously enjoy the rendition of Goodbye Yellow Brick Road playing in this trailer', 'CGI looks incredible i think they wont mess this up as they are introducing Kang The Conqueror Can t wait to see it on the big screen Congratulations to everyone who worked on this project', 'Love how comic accurate they made kangs suit It works so well on the big screen Jonathan Majors is gon na kill it', 'Yes I personally love the Ant Man movies I think they re very underappreciated And seeing this trailer has me even more hyped for Quantamania than I already was', 'I like the idea that every time we see kang it s a different variant Keeps it more interesting for the audience and no doubt for Jonathan majors Seriously I loved him as He Who Remains and to think that s a nice guy version of kang', 'This looks amazing Not gon na lie I think this could hands down be one of the best projects out of this saga It feels so much more grand on a cinematic scale Always been a fan of Peyton Reed s Ant Man films and I feel like he s gon na knock it out of the park with this one', 'So Sad that so many people hate this movie i Don t understand This movie is not that bad i love the characters of kang and the story Line is good to Im not understand What other people want it actually i like this movie', 'The saddest thing about this new movie is the fact that Stan Lee and Jack Kirby bless their hearts are no longer around to see one of their most important creations after years of mistreatment finally done justice on the big screen', 'Amen to that Marvel I love you forever 3000', 'Dude this trailer gives me goosebumps', 'Just saw this movie earlier today and omg it was so good', 'I love how it s a running joke that Ben simply refuses to say ITS CLOBBERIN TIME Can t wait to see this in IMAX', 'One of the small things I love most about this movie was that Ben wasn t ever at one point ever called the thing It was truly about family Dom would be proud', 'It s gon na feel like ascending when Ben says It s Clobbering Time', 'I JUST SAW IT ON IMAX it was Fantastic', 'Saw this last night and I have to say I absolutely loved it Where the new superman movie has heart this has soul', 'I like the idea of Franklin Richards sneezing basically resetting the entire MCU since he can warp change reality', 'I like how in this movie the comedy comes from the interaction between characters and not random throwaway jokes', 'A good friend of mine just took me to see this movie It was good', 'Still mesmerized by this animation I haven t seen the film yet but this is probably why I want to see it so bad now So beautiful', 'I m so glad that they didn t actually show what Galactus looks like fully in any of the trailers All should know Elons Xonedium', 'Now that is how you do the setting for a Fantastic Four movie This Retro Futurism is gorgeous', 'Saw this specific trailer in the theaters recently and I swear hearing that fantastic four chant echoing around me in the cinema was INSANE Literal goosebumps', 'I didn t expect to love this as much as I do', 'i saw this actually pretty good', 'Movie was AMAZING LOVED IT', 'THIS MOVIE WAS FANTASTIC', 'Just finished watching it and I Love It I was skeptical with silver

they got it right', 'That s just in the cartoon That gave me a good laugh', 'Best Marvel movie since Infinity War This movie actually had a soul It wasn t made just for the sake of releasing a movie or making money The script the casting the art direction the cinematography was DRIPPING with passion and love If you re watching the trailer trying to decide if you want to see the movie and you see this comment I want you to know that this isn t just a comic book movie it s a film It s exactly what I want out of a comic book movie It was made with love and care it cares about the source material and it isn t afraid to be what it is A Fantastic Four film It s like you ve dunked your head INTO a comic book', 'What I really like about this trailer is that it starts off so light and innocent until 0 45 when the bottom falls out And the way they change the entire tone of the trailer with that one note', 'Thank God they didn t mess it up like they did with Superman but that s what you expect from DC movies The Fantastic Four finally feels like it s in the right hands What really sets it apart is that beautiful vintage touch it gives the film a unique identity that stands out from the typical MCU formula It feels like a respectful nod to the classic comics while still offering something fresh If Marvel keeps this tone consistent this might actually be the Fantastic Four film we ve been waiting for', 'Finally a fantastic four movie that didn t suck I was so scared I didn t watch until now I m so happy I did', 'Saw it tonight It was pretty good It s a shame it came out after the oh so many boss babe super hero slop fests of late A little slow in the beginning but all in all I was entertained and didn t feel like I was being skull f cked by the message during the entire movie Sue storm was a really great character Her and Reed Richards complemented one another very well She was motherly nurturing and protective She reaches the height of her abilities when in the act of protecting her child It was refreshing for a movie to contain a societally helpful message for the 1st time in such a long time', 'It s everything Superman wished it could be I went in expecting to be disappointed Ohhh was I wrong This is the BEST Fantastic 4 movie ever Again Marvel Cinematic Universe snatches the win from DCU', 'Never been a fan of the Fantastic 4 but honestly this looks so freaking good', 'Well done movie Could have used an extra 25 minutes tho', 'Reed and Johnny s powers look SO GOOD', 'I just watched it and all I can say is that they did a great job with the casting',

movie So fitting', 'The Film is good I Seen it yesterday', 'I love that they took the scene of Johnny making the 4 symbol in the sky with his flames that was one of the best moments of that old FF franchise This movie s gon na be great', 'The trailer look fantastic I m excited for this movie everyone looks amazing in their parts music get me emotional every time giacchino is cooking', 'Just saw

the feeling that many many many others will not be capable of liking it It was really stupid but it was really smart The plot was odd but it made sense if you understand something about string theory It was a big huge stinking pile of tons of brand new characters and brand new species and brand new ideas all shoved as tightly together as possible into one big pile of science fiction on steroids And then of course the left added their propaganda to it but that part wasn t too terrible I would even go so far as to say that the movie is not woke in any perceptible way Lastly some profanity some of which can not be simply edited out later on because of how it often happens at key points within the storyline As a long time comic book nerd I m ok with lots of sciency stuff mixed together with lots of science fictiony stuff I m ok with it I think a lot of others might not be though A lot of others might deeply hate it It was an interesting movie but you had to be the sort of person who can tolerate a lot This is not the way that Marvel will regain its audience And because of the profanity I have no plans to buy the BluRay or DVD when it comes out It was as bad as a movie can be and still be considered good by nerds like me I ll give it 6 out of ten stars Plan on a whole bunch of other people giving it far fewer though', 'the movie was avarage and the daughter is so annoying we

last 1 4 of the movie was good to me', 'Watching it now and it s quite good so far But heres the problem i have the Baxter Building is the most technologically advanced building on the planet apart from maybe The Fortress of Solitude And it doesnt have any backups of any kind when the power is out No giant batteries or a Reed Richards invented generator of any kind That seem absolutely stupid to me The whole building should basically be a self sufficient nuclear power plant So Ben shouldn t have any problems shaving', 'Watched the movie In general it was good But The end was so bad I don t know how to feel The finale should be the peak But that s not the case in this movie The final battle was terrible But I won t spoil from antagonist soloed smh', 'Watched it today Average movie', 'Avarage movie', 'This movie was 5 10 at best', 'I saw this film yesterday It was decent but Pascal as Reed was a horrible miscast It was a financial cast appealing to a built in audience rather than an artistic choice', 'Somewhere between okay and really disappointing', 'I m here after thor love and thunder just to remind myself when thor was awesome', 'It s well intentioned but ultimately

actress wasn t that popular very annoying It s discrimination Darren Cross as M O D O K I like Darren as The Yellow Jacket is too annoying I thought he was dead MCU bringing the dead back to life is just as worse as Fast and Furious Bill Murray as villain is depressing I don t like bringing in new new unwanted characters I thought the storyline would be some other problem but they added Janet s

apart from maybe galactus', 'This movie is absolutely boring It s what to expect when you re expecting a cosmic baby and an advertisement for ABC They should ve left the Red Ghost in it and made it a show on Disney plus The only reason why I didn t fall asleep in the theater is because I think the employees were looking for someone and came in several times to try to find them And the actor playing Johnny Storm looks too much like RDJr when he was younger The score was too much hype for such a slow movie There was no good soundtrack could ve added some 50s or 60s music but I guess that
