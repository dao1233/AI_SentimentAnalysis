pains to underline just how impossible it will be to stop Hela by normal superhero methods', 'Thor throws Mjolnir and Hela just catches it headfirst As The Immigrant Song s intro ramps up the tension she makes a pants wetting display of power by calmly slowly gripping her bare fingers around the Uru relic tight enough to shatter it her face never tenses or even changes expression from that bemused smirk At the moment the magic contained within explodes outward the real melody and action starts', 'I did I went to opening night last night and saw it It was awesome I was so happy to hear this song in the movie twice', 'This trailer is some kind of brain poison I am addicted and watching it all day', 'YES We know each other from work This is why I ve been waiting for a year for this movie',

trailer song is a genius Combining yellow brick road by Elton John with the Loki theme was brilliant composing Hats off to them', 'Whoever came up with the song and the trailer deserve a big raise', 'This has the potential to be the best of the Ant Man movies', 'Even if the movie itself was far from the best Marvel movie this was one of the best Marvel trailers imo Even after watching the movie I still get chills from this trailer', 'Jonathan Majors is such a great actor I m so glad he s getting his role fully enveloped within the MCU', 'I love how Kang sounds so calm yet at the same time so terrifying', 'I love how Scott says that the people who adores him often calls him as Spider Man by mistake while the Next Big Bad that is Kang knows that he s the one and only Ant Man', 'I see this trailer almost everyday because I work at a movie theater and it never fails to amaze me', 'Can we take a moment to appreciate the VFX artists The visuals are stunning', 'The buildup to more comic book accurate suits is phenomenal Can t wait', 'I m obsessed with Jonathan Majors as Kang The guy is phenomenal and clearly puts everything he has into his roles Very excited to see what he brings to the role over the next several years', 'I can already tell that Majors is gon na absolutely kill it as Kang This is gon na be amazing', 'It s wild how even in just this short clip you can tell that

goes It s you Ant man the Wasp Quantumania', 'Kang s lines in this trailer are giving me chills Jonathan Majors is going to give one hell of a performance here I m so excited', 'The trailer and the song go together perfectly', 'Round of applause for the composer who blended Elton John s Goodbye Yellow Brick Road into the Loki theme and then back out into Yellow Brick Road Beautifully done', 'I love how vastly different He Who Remains and Kang the Conqueror are Just from their speaking tones you can tell how different they are HWR is more joyous and playful especially when he still held the cards Kang is more proud in his speaking it has a sort of power like he knows he more powerful than whoever he talks to and his speaking is so cold too Jonathan Majors is an amazing actor', 'The quantum realm looks so beautiful', 'This looks awesome Everything about it seems so disconnected from everything we ve already seen in the mcu almost like a guardians vibe it almost feels like a standalone scifi movie', 'Casting Jonathan Majors as Kang was such a great idea He s a truly talented upcoming actor He s just got that swag someone would need to be the next Thanos level villain',

adventure', 'I think this movie has a bright future', 'I think Antman has one of the best and most consistent story arcs in the MCU I love it', 'The amount of goosebumps this gave me is surreal Mavel

incredible screen presence There s a special aura to him every time he appears in something He looks great as Kang The Conqueror a villain who I ve been waiting to see adapted for a long time I m very happy for the success he s having', 'Even thought the movie was controversial the trailers were phenomenal', 'What I love about Kang is that he has no powers is no strong alien or something else He is just smart and one of the biggest threats in the Marvel Universe I just love that', 'It may be just me but I love how they were to pull it off and give Kang his iconic face even though it may be a mask he wears while traveling', 'Is it just me or this movie has that guardians of the galaxy feel with all of the aliens and beautiful imagery and the song just fits i m so excited for this movie', 'Can t wait for Spider Man and the Wasp Quantumania Looks really good Also glad that they gave Scott Lang some role too he s heavily underrated', 'So excited to see Jonathan majors back his portrayal of he who remains was amazing and can t wait to see him as Kang', 'the musical score of this trailer is off the charts i love it', 'I ve always felt like the Ant Man movies are super underrated I m very excited for this next one', 'Even from a few seconds in this trailer you can see Jonathan Majors incredible range His comedic demeanour in Loki is SO different to the stoic aloof kinda vibe he s giving off here I ve literally seen this man act in one episode of a show and a 2 minute trailer and I m already blown away by him', 'I really enjoy the retro futuristic instrumental in this trailer It definitely ties back to Loki through the music', 'That first scene was incredibly epic Seeing Kang gave me chills They might be skimping on CGI on Disney to save money but I m relieved to see they aren t pulling punches with the CGI here Looks incredible Really looking forward to this', 'I love the Spiderman franchise so hyped for this next instalment of it', 'This movie looks like it ll have major effects on the MCU big picture wise I m so excited to see Jonathan Majors again He s so charismatic and I love that we ll be seeing different versions of Kang', 'I seriously enjoy the rendition of Goodbye Yellow Brick Road playing in this trailer', 'CGI looks incredible i think they wont mess this up as they are introducing Kang The Conqueror Can t wait to see it on the big screen Congratulations to everyone who worked on this project', 'Love how comic accurate they made kangs suit It works so well on the big screen Jonathan Majors is gon na kill it', 'Yes I personally love the Ant Man movies I think they re very underappreciated And seeing this trailer has me even more hyped for Quantamania than I already was', 'I like the idea that every time we see kang it s a different variant Keeps it more interesting for the audience and no doubt for Jonathan majors Seriously I loved him as He Who Remains and to think that s a nice guy version of kang', 'This looks amazing Not gon na lie I think this could hands down be one of the best projects out of this saga It feels so much more grand on a cinematic scale Always been a fan of Peyton Reed s Ant Man films and I feel like he s gon na knock it out of the park with this one', 'So Sad that so many people hate this movie i Don t understand This movie is not that bad i love the characters of kang and the story Line is good to Im not understand What other people want it actually i like this movie', 'The saddest thing about this new movie is the fact that Stan Lee and Jack Kirby bless their hearts are no longer around to see one of their most important creations after years of mistreatment finally done justice on the big screen', 'Amen to that Marvel I love you forever 3000', 'Dude this trailer gives me goosebumps', 'Just saw this movie earlier today and omg it was so good', 'I love how it s a running joke that Ben simply refuses to say ITS CLOBBERIN TIME Can t wait to see this in IMAX', 'One of the small things I love

until 0 45 when the bottom falls out And the way they change the entire tone of the trailer with that one note', 'Thank God they didn t mess it up like they did with Superman but that s what you expect from DC movies The Fantastic Four finally feels like it s in the right hands What really sets it apart is that beautiful vintage touch it gives the film a unique identity that stands out from

ve been waiting for', 'Finally a fantastic four movie that didn t suck I was so scared I didn t watch until now I m so happy I did', 'Saw it tonight It was pretty good It s a shame it came out after

looks fine to me', 'The movie was mid like the movie felt more like a star wars movie than an ant man movie while it was still good i simply think this is my least favorite ant man film', 'I didn t hate it and I actually found it to be quite entertaining Unfortunately I get the feeling that many many many others will not be capable of liking it It was really stupid but it was really smart The plot was odd but it made sense if you understand something about string theory It was a big huge stinking pile of tons of brand new characters and brand new species and brand new ideas all shoved as tightly together as possible into one big pile of science fiction on steroids And then of course the left added their propaganda to it but that part wasn t too terrible I would even go so far as to say that the movie is not woke in any perceptible way Lastly some profanity some of which can not be simply edited out later on because of how it often happens at key points within the storyline As a long time comic book nerd I m ok with lots of sciency stuff mixed together with lots of science fictiony stuff I m ok with it I think a lot of others might not be though A lot of others might deeply hate it It was an interesting movie but you had to be the sort of person who can tolerate a lot This is not the way that Marvel will regain its audience And because of the profanity I have no plans to buy the BluRay or DVD when it comes out It was as bad as a movie can be and still be considered good by nerds like me I ll give it 6 out of ten stars Plan on a whole bunch of other people giving it far fewer though', 'the movie was avarage and the daughter is so annoying we need more deaths and less idiotic characters', 'movies are not that bad but no excitement coz of trailer spoilers', 'The

Four is mentioned a total of 7 times in this trailer The choir chorus says it 6 times And no I m not complaining for I love that theme', 'It s not bad movie Pedro pascal has been underutilized', 'It was ok', 'I m here to say that the movie was great just the actors were horrible The only good one was thing and the human torch Oh btw human torch will get recasted as Ironman you heard it here first

the most technologically advanced building on the planet apart from maybe The Fortress of Solitude And it doesnt have any backups of any kind when the power is out No giant batteries or a Reed Richards invented generator of any kind That seem absolutely stupid to me The whole building should basically be a self sufficient nuclear power plant So Ben shouldn t have any problems shaving', 'Watched the movie In general it was good But The end was so bad I don t know how to feel The finale should be the peak But that s not the case in this movie The final battle was terrible But I won t spoil from antagonist soloed smh', 'Watched it today Average movie', 'Avarage movie', 'This movie was 5 10 at best', 'I saw this film yesterday It was decent but Pascal as Reed was a horrible miscast

'It wasn t horrible It is hard to connect with character cuz there are so many but I think that problem will go away with time since they will continue to appear in the future mcu', 'Just recently saw this movie and I got ta say honestly underwhelmed by it It s not a horrible movie just average at best Might have turned out better if they instead split this movie into two one focusing on the past and what caused the Eternals to split and go their separate ways the other focused on the re emergence of Deviants It d give proper time for us to know them as characters in the first movie then they could establish that sentient Deviant as a proper villain in the second movie and make him feel like more of a threat', 'Honestly not a good movie but not a bad movie Definitely enjoyable', 'This movie is too overhated it wasn t the best but it wasn t the worst', 'For me I rate it 5 5 out of 10', 'It was alright Imo one of the better phase 4 marvel movies', 'I saw the movie it s not the best or the worst but I enjoyed the humor', 'I watched Eternals on disney plus Not as bad as people say it is I def think there s worse marvel movies out there I loved how unique and informative this movie

year', 'Not exactly everyone will love this movie But yes it seeriously sucks No offense', 'Its a awesome trailer but the movie sucks', 'I m not dogging the movie the approach was admirable Really I feel like the trailer was misleading It gave a good perspective of the take off the suit and what are you question But I think it could have been written better The first Iron Man will always be the best', 'In retrospect I can totally imagine the guys who planned how they were going to market the movie to be giggling incessantly and rubbing their hands together whenever someone watched the trailer and thought it would be the dark chapter of Tony Stark s life', 'you re maybe not matured enough to handle the dark knight rises movie and plot developement get lost and play the power rangers toys dumbass', 'avengers was way better and i didnt even like it', 'Utterly disappointed a great talent wasted', 'says this is the best ironman movie out of the 3 on some movie sites its the worst by far plus they got the mandarin all wrong the bad was really just a bad version of the human torch it shoulda been called tony stark not ironman cause the movie goes about an hour and a half with no ironman yawn', 'A disappointing movie', 'This movie sucks to be honest Only iron man fanboys would tell you it s good', 'Saw part3 yesterday MAJOR LETDOWN', 'Expecting a Villain Epic intelligent cruel ruthless take Hero to despair was not the mockery Disappointing movie zero emotion If this was the last is a terrible end', 'I unfortunately hate this movie In my opinion I think the mandarin part the twist is really out of place and ruins the villain in the movie in the beginning It felt like he was a real villain kind of like the joker in the dark knight You get this presence of a real threat even depicted in the trailers But when the twist came I Lost interest in the movie entireley It is not as good as the original', 'So many flaws in the movie it doesn t deserve the praise it gets It was entertaining and better from the second one but nothing more than that', 'I didn t like it at all most of the people i know didn t like it either Bad movie with a lot of hype Don t waste your money', 'For the ones who haven t seen it the trailers are so much better than the final product There s a twist right in the middle of the movie that makes this the worst Marvel film to date It s an OK movie maybe an OK Marvel film but is an awful Iron Man movie If other movies of Marvel s Phase Two are anywhere near this Disney can start crumbling because DC and Warner are coming strong PS I m a fan of both companies', 'big mistake replacing Chris Evans as Captain America The gross sale from domestic and internal are flop', 'The most unrealistic thing in this isn t the CGI but that the US president seems to be a real badass', 'The fact that the film is going for it s 5th reshoot after another poor audience testing I have very little hope that this film can live up to what it s trying to sell which seems like The Winter Solider 2 0', 'None of the fights in this film will top the one Mackie lost to Eminem', 'Not being nitpicky but as an engineer who understands physics and math Sam s wings in the scene at the very end of this trailer where Sam sliced the car in two those wings should ve been more rigid instead of flappy If they re loose or flappy the physics wouldn t be right for vibranium wings to generate enough slicing force AND a simple somersault is also not sufficient to generate the slicing force either it has to gain momentum first and be at a certain speed like a chainsaw It should ve been a double or even triple somersault to slice a car coming at you in speed I know it s suspension of disbelief but IMHO it s more easily swallowed if the physics is correct or it s explained the wings is charged with some kind of energy', 'Still don t know why they would pick a C rate actor to play Captain America Hope this movie bombs it looks terrible', 'That doesn t look or feel like a Marvel movie It looks like a 90 percent drama 10 percent action movie in which I would fall fast to sleep', 'Most silly and disgusting movie of all time by marvel', 'Extremely stupid movie', 'This movie was so bad the cringy oh you didnt know the wakandans gave him an upgrade the talking down the red hulk You just wasted a great villian for dei captain america', 'Only one captain America falcon suited him don t know why they decided to change it I like him but as captain America he will never fit the boots', 'Captain America should stay original as the comic books created it to be Stop trying to change history just make new superheroes in the color you want Next thing Black Superman Black snow white Already ruined with Black little mermaid black Annie Mind you I m not racist just fed up with this crap Make your own darn stories stop ruining good movies and turning them into dunk with your race ideology PLEASE', 'It still bothers how the abilities and its interactions with other characters seems inconsistent Those vibranium wings are taking so much hit and I forget if it was ever said in the wakanda films if it doesn t have a limit or what happens after it had a limit and who knew vibranium can cut hulk s skin maybe he s not as tough as hulk But if that vibranium can take that much hit and it seems to not have a limit to the amount of power it can store than it s so OP and clearly we don t really see that with blackpanther except the one time it exploded in end game but if you really think about it he could concentrate all the damage he took for some 15min in full battle and use it on one punch and it s probably stronger than hulks punch The only thing I like about this movie is when that red hulk was chasing sam at near the end It reminded me of how good ang lee s hulk was in showing its ability and strength', 'Can we get a realistic movie where captain America while starving gives all his money to captain Israel who uses it for crime Now that s a movie I ll watch Marvels movies are all lame now', 'if brave new world not succeed there is only reason 1 the player really unexpected 2 there is red hulk', 'So just started watching this movie 20 minutes ago for the first time ever in any avengers Ironman or captain America movies have I ever considered turning it off Acting is bad Script is bad What happened I was so

look promising at all', 'Trailer 4 5 5 Movie 3 5', 'DSMOM was a disappoinment The entire movie only focus on Wanda MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS but only visit one universe The trailer pranked fanbase', 'This is just me I m left disappointed False advertising on Marvel s end What is it with Sam Raimi and campy humor', 'This movie had potential but instead it was rushed and wasted', 'The writing in this film was god awful and it is more Wandavision 2 feat Dr Strange than Doctor Strange 2', 'don t know how they managed to make a doctor strange movie bad', 'God this movie was disappointing first go around', 'this movie had so much potential but it sucks', 'it makes me so sad that the movie isn t good', 'too bad the actual movie sucks Raimi did what he could with what he was given but Waldron ruined the movie with his shitty writing Waldron is the next Alex Kurtzman a shitty writer that they hired to try to write and build cinematic universes only to FAIL HORRIBLY and Waldron and Gao RUINED the MCU', 'I watched the movie and I was disappointed I came in extremely hyped but the trailer was just the biggest bait ever Honestly I d rather watch the movie of the trailer s implied version than the actual one that came out Just an opinion', 'The movie was a big disappointment writer didn t read the script of Wanda vision and the movie main focus was Wanda instead of Doctor strange Sam raimi doesn t care about the doctor strange character at all The Cameos was just a money grabbing tactical option that s it', 'this trailer was SOOOOO misleading WHY IN THE HELL WOULD IT START WITH dont cast that spell its too dangerous it makes it sound like the stakes and dangers and destruction are being caused because of the spells dr Strange did in spiderman no way home rewatching this trailer honestly makes me dislike dr Strange 2 even more', 'I hate marvel after they add illuminati in this movie', 'That s so lame', 'What a disappointing movie this was', 'I m sorry

your universe', 'It s Feel awful when In this movie every avengers characters died easily I mean why', 'BAIT AND SWITCH GARBAGE', 'So dissapointed how marvel just wasted all potential line on this trailer by shitty storyline', 'Dissapointed to see that in fact not Strange was the villain here but crybaby Wanda that lost her imaginery kids L take', 'This movie sucked Iron Man 2 of Phase 4 It could have been so much better', 'Well they lied to us', 'the movie was a massive disappointment', 'this movie sucked thor sucked marvel is going downhill maybe black panther will bomb', 'The worst marvel movie of all Stupid story comedy lame effects okay reminded me of Venom 2 which was also that bad following movie very sad', 'One of the most disappointed marvel movie', 'The movie is unfortunately weak and poorly scripted They are pushing politics into the movie as well The characters are rushed and misplaced The end objective is unlear I wonder if I just watched a marvel movie or not Except the excellent cgi must rather say excellently weak and boring storyline However oddly one of the best trailers that got me wanting more to see it but disappointed now more than ever of the direction marvel is heading here on', 'this gives me a bad feeling', 'Do not watch this pos movie it s so woke It needs to take a nap fortunately for me I was able to get a full refund 20 minutes into this pos So disappointed with what Disney s done to the Marvel franchise', 'this film is sooooo badddddddddddd', 'I was really excited for this movie but was let down not because I was expecting a cameo movie because the trailer was nothing like the movie I did not enjoy what they did with the villian because it just defeats the point of one of the Disney plus shows and dumb people are still defending the villian even after killing so many innocent lives This movie did not feel like a doctor strange movie he was literally nerfed so hard and kept getting defeated every time HE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THIS WEAK IF THE MAIN VILLIAN IS STRONG BECAUSE THEY WERE STRONG IN THE COMICS HE SHOULD BE STRONG AS WELL BECAUSE HE IS STRONGER IN THE COMICS This movie gets a 3 10 for me Sam raimi couldn t even save this movie Idc what anyone thinks of this it s my opinion deal with it I m not going to suck up to a movie that did my FAVORITE SUPER HERO DIRTY IN HIS OWN MOVIE MCU IS DEAD', 'Just watched it and amazingly despite having same artists same production company and technology it s sooo boring']\n"

this comment I want you to know that this isn t just a comic book movie it s a film It s exactly what I want out of a comic book movie It was made with love and care it cares about the source material and it isn t afraid to be what it is A Fantastic Four film It s like you ve dunked your head INTO a comic book', 'What I really like about this trailer is that it starts off so light and innocent until 0 45 when the bottom falls out And the way they change the entire tone of the trailer with that one note', 'Thank God they didn t mess it up like they did with Superman but that s what you expect from DC movies The Fantastic Four finally feels like it s in the right hands What really sets it apart is that beautiful vintage touch it gives the film a unique identity that stands out from

movie Sue storm was a really great character Her and Reed Richards complemented one another very well She was motherly nurturing and protective She reaches the height of her abilities when in the act

a superhero movie took a different turn than the rest doesn t mean you have to be spoonfed all your storylines You were fooled the reason why you didn t like it was because you weren t expecting the things that happened to actually happen Tony Stark is a stronger character because of this movie', 'the Mandarin was right I didn t see him coming really good movie', 'ohh this movie was good just wish the mandarin took the complete role as the true villian the character was crazy with the hoody Robe plus the voice nnd d way he talked ohh i could imagine how epic he would have if they developed his character into the main villian', '1 50 The musical transition here is just so perfect It went from despair to hope using the last note of a dark tone and bringing in the first note of the

think this is my least favorite ant man film', 'I didn t hate it and I actually found it to be quite entertaining Unfortunately I get the feeling that many many many others will not be capable of liking it It was really stupid but it was really smart The plot was odd but it made sense if you understand something about string theory It was a big huge stinking pile of tons of brand new characters and brand new species and brand new ideas all shoved as tightly together as possible into one big pile of science fiction on steroids And then of course the left added their propaganda to it but that part wasn t too terrible I would even go so far as to say that the movie is not woke in any perceptible way Lastly some profanity some of which can not be simply edited out later on because of how it often happens at key points within the storyline As a long time comic book nerd I m ok with lots of sciency stuff mixed together with lots of science fictiony stuff I m ok with it I think a lot of others might not be though A lot of others might deeply hate it It was an interesting movie but you had to be the sort of person who can tolerate a lot This is not the way that Marvel will regain its audience And because of the profanity I have no plans to buy the BluRay or DVD when it comes out It was as bad as a movie can be and still be considered good by nerds like me I ll give

it doesnt have any backups of any kind when the power is out No giant batteries or a Reed Richards invented generator of any kind That seem absolutely stupid to me The whole building should basically be a self sufficient nuclear power plant So Ben shouldn t have any problems shaving', 'Watched the movie In general it was good But The end was so bad I don t know how to feel The finale should be the peak But that s not the case in this movie The final battle was terrible But I won t spoil from antagonist soloed smh', 'Watched it today Average movie', 'Avarage movie', 'This movie was 5 10 at

ok', 'I thought it was an okay movie but after another viewing it s good than the first', 'It wasn t horrible It is hard to connect with character cuz there are so many but I think that problem will go away with time since they will continue to appear in the future mcu', 'Just recently saw this movie and I got ta say honestly underwhelmed by it It s not a horrible movie just average at best Might have turned out better if they instead split this movie into two one focusing on the past and what caused the Eternals to split and go their separate ways the other focused on the re emergence of Deviants It d give proper time for us to know them as characters in the first movie then they could establish that sentient Deviant as a proper villain in the second movie and make him feel like more of a threat', 'Honestly not a good movie but not a bad movie Definitely enjoyable', 'This movie is too overhated it wasn t the best but it wasn t the worst', 'For me I rate it 5 5 out of 10', 'It was alright Imo one of the better phase 4 marvel movies', 'I saw the movie it s not the best or the worst but I enjoyed the humor', 'I watched Eternals on disney plus Not as bad as people say it is I def

can store than it s so OP and clearly we don t really see that with blackpanther except the one time it exploded in end game but if you really think about it he could concentrate all the damage he took for some 15min in full battle and use it on one punch and it s probably stronger than hulks punch The only thing I like about this movie is when that red hulk was chasing sam at near the end It

looking forward to seeing this So far it s not even close to the standard of any avengers or captain America movies I m going back to watch the rest see if it improves but at this stage it does not look promising at all', 'They really should have followed the trailer s words and actually had Taskmaster CONTROL the Red Room I m perfectly fine with who they wanted Taskmaster to be but they should have just kept them as the actual main villain', 'Clueless Disney had to ruin Taskmaster because Widow couldn t beat the comic version lol', 'It s disappointing how badass Taskmaster was in the trailer compared to the actual film', 'I wish they had focus more on the red room and what happend there', 'The Russians accents are definitely a little off', 'I expected black widow movie to be as dark as a flashback shown of red room in Age of Ultron in movie they made us feel Natasha is less intelligent she was so sidelined like what kind of tribute film was it They just gave importance to Yelena very disappointed']\n"
