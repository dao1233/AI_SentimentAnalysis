this last night and I have to say I absolutely loved it Where the new superman movie has heart this has soul', 'I like the idea of Franklin Richards sneezing basically resetting the entire MCU since

cartoon That gave me a good laugh', 'Best Marvel movie since Infinity War This movie actually had a soul It wasn t made just for the sake of releasing a movie or making money The script the casting the art direction the cinematography was DRIPPING with passion and love If you re watching the trailer trying to decide if you want to see the movie and you see this comment I want you to know that this isn t just a comic book movie it s a film It s exactly what I want out of a comic book movie It was made with love and care it cares about the source material and it isn t afraid to be what it is A Fantastic Four film It s like you ve dunked your head INTO a comic book', 'What I really like about this trailer is that it starts off so light and innocent until 0 45 when the bottom falls out And the way they change the entire tone of the trailer with that one note', 'Thank God they didn t mess it up like they did with Superman but that s what you expect from DC movies The Fantastic Four finally feels like it s in the right hands What really sets it apart is that beautiful vintage touch it gives the film a unique identity that stands out from the typical MCU formula It feels like a respectful nod to the classic comics while still offering something fresh If Marvel keeps this tone consistent this might actually be the Fantastic Four film we ve been waiting for', 'Finally a fantastic four movie that didn t suck I was so scared I didn t watch until now I m so happy I did', 'Saw it tonight It was pretty good It s a shame it came out after the oh so many boss babe super hero slop fests of late A little slow in the beginning but all in all I was entertained and didn t feel like I was being skull f cked by the message during the entire movie Sue storm was a really great character Her and Reed Richards complemented one another very well She was motherly nurturing and protective She reaches the height of her abilities when in the act of protecting her child It was refreshing for a movie to contain a societally helpful message for the 1st time in such a long time', 'It s everything Superman wished it could be I went in expecting to be disappointed Ohhh was I wrong This is the BEST Fantastic 4 movie ever Again Marvel Cinematic Universe snatches the win from DCU', 'Never been a fan of the Fantastic 4 but honestly this looks so freaking good', 'Well done

Four is mentioned a total of 7 times in this trailer The choir chorus says it 6 times And no I m not complaining for I love that theme', 'It s not bad movie Pedro pascal has been underutilized', 'It was ok', 'I m here to say that the movie was great just the actors were horrible The only good one was thing and the human torch Oh btw human torch will get recasted as Ironman you heard it here first

the most technologically advanced building on the planet apart from maybe The Fortress of Solitude And it doesnt have any backups of any kind when the power is out No giant batteries or a Reed Richards invented generator of any kind That seem absolutely stupid to me The whole building should basically be a self sufficient nuclear power plant So Ben shouldn t have any problems shaving',

spoil from antagonist soloed smh', 'Watched it today Average movie', 'Avarage movie', 'This movie was 5 10 at best', 'I saw this film yesterday It was decent but Pascal as Reed was a horrible miscast

good', 'No ones watching it after the first weekend lol It was not good Superman was ok and better lol', 'im not hating It was ok Decent Too jumpy torch and things relationship was off Pascal was

worst', 'but it was bad', 'thunderbolts was leagues ahead of marvels an actual strong film in the series of mediocre stuff marvel has put out', 'guess what it suckss', 'It will probably suck but if

vibing with the casting here', 'This is absolutely the worse most absolutely stupid super hero if not MOVIE of all time For some reason they can t make a good movie either time out of this That s to

out of the waters', 'this is so stupid the original fantastic four movie was just fine we dont need this dumbass cringy 2025 remake that doesnt even have any of the right actors', 'No thanks not even going to watch it for free on one of those dodgy sites The cast sucks and they keep insulting normal People Actualy i dont watch anything with Fake Pedro By the way central Am rica and some of the south were colonized by the Spanish so Pedro you are a Colonizer And your family probably owned American Indian slaves and slauther them for gold', 'Brooooo This Movie is Trash', 'It s a testament to the state of the MCU that even when you strip away all the required reading and focus on a standalone film it still sucks', 'There are tons of materials that they can pick from to do a new Fantastic Four movie And they decided to remake the 2007 Fantastic Four No wonder this franchise can t get off the ground', 'Ok saw the movie now on steaming with Disney Im so happy that i was not in the cinema because this is the worste F4 movie ever in history I cant understand why they used Pedro Pascal for the role of Reed Richards And the woman from Mission Impossible oh my god I think this worse play can only topped by the badest human torge ever Who is this guy Really It looks like a 14 year old kid And sorry Marvel but THIS story is wow i have no words I understand why the MCU is killed since Endgame After this F4 movie i made my decission of no superhero movies in future', 'Boring movie and what was the aim of that move I mean any lesson How to birth a child in space or what Is that really easy even not on earth to born a baby I was just sleepy all the time while I went to watch that movie plus ugly rock guy why should we see that man do they really need him Please try to make it good next time thanks', 'I HATE when they make ACTION movies into SOAP OPERAS I m sensing this is ANOTHER WASTE of time The F4 couldn t fight Galactus They d need The WHOLE Marvel UNIVERSE to fight him I think this is gon na be pretty whack I ll be BACK to apologize if by some miraculous circumstances I was wrong', 'looks rubbish', 'This looks horrible nothing about this movie looks interesting apart from maybe galactus', 'This movie is absolutely boring It s what to expect when you re expecting a cosmic baby and an advertisement for ABC They should ve left the Red Ghost in it and made it a show on Disney plus The only reason why I didn t fall asleep in the theater is because I think the employees were looking for someone and came in several times to try to find them And the actor playing Johnny Storm looks too much like RDJr when he was younger The score was too much hype for such a slow movie There was no good soundtrack could ve added some 50s or 60s music but I guess that earth didn t have any the end song made you tired before going on the road to drive home The only good thing about it was Ben he was a gem', 'This movie was sooooo bad Seriously me and my nephew fell a sleep', 'This was without a doubt the lamest F4 movie since the 1994', 'This movie is so boring', 'This is absolutely the worse most absolutely stupid super hero if not MOVIE of all time For some reason they can t make a good movie either time out of this That s to bad So much potential This is just lame I d give it a zero out of ten From casting to story line Especially storyline I can t believe I paid 6 bucks for it']\n"
