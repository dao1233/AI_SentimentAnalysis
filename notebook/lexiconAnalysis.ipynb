I get goosebumps watching this back because when you saw that avengers logo and hear the theme ring in , you just feel everything that had built up to this point in the MCU .\n",

Having Spacehog in this trailer made me bawl my eyes out , as it was one of our favorite songs to play while we were cooking or dancing in the living room on our days off together .
