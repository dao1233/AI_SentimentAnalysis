A little slow in the beginning but all in all I was entertained and did n't feel like I was being skull f * cked by `` the message '' during the entire movie . Sue storm was a really great character . Her and Reed Richards complemented one another very well . She was motherly , nurturing , and protective . She reaches the height of her abilities when in the act of protecting her child . It was refreshing for a movie to contain a societally helpful message for the 1st time , in such a long time .\n",
