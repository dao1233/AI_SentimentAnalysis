Not even the occasional inspired touch can save it.', 'It certainly coordinated things well to leave impressions. The trailer takes careful pains to underline just how impossible it will be to stop Hela by normal superhero methods.', 'Thor throws Mjolnir and Hela just catches it headfirst. As \"The Immigrant Song\"\\'s intro ramps up the tension, she makes a pants-wetting display of power by calmly, slowly gripping her bare fingers around the Uru relic tight enough to shatter it; her face never tenses or even changes expression from that bemused smirk.
